Persistence roll. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take
non-offensive actions. The target may run if it so chooses and may dodge and
normally parry in combat.  Any skills that have INT as a base are at -20% when
tested while the target is under the effects of this spell.</p>
<p>This spell is effective against humanoids and natural creatures. Other
creatures (such as spirits or magical beasts like dragons) are not affected by
this spell.</p>"

single spirit of a given type from the Spirit World to do the bidding of the
caster. The spirit resists the call by using its Persistence. If it succeeds, it
can return to the Spirit World. Unless combined with a Binding attempt (see
below), the spirit that fails a Persistence roll must perform one action, within
its power, for the caster, after which it returns to the Spirit World.</p>

possessed victim.</li> <li>Passion (Fear/Madness/Pain) these spirits work upon
the passions of a victim and cause mental debilitation and distress.</li>

Binding Spirits,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,,"<p>If the character wants to bind a spirit, they must engage in spiritual
combat. If they win, they can bind the spirit to an item or their person, by
spending an additional growth point. If they fail, the spirit either flees to
the Spirit World if it is a Magic or Healing spirit or possesses the caster if
it is a Disease or Passion spirit.</p>"
Care,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,Touch,"<p>This spell places the recipient under the care of the caster.  If the caster
has any active Protection or Countermagic spells, the character under the
effects of the Care spell also benefits from the effects of these spells.</p>"
Clear Path,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Touch,"<p>This spell allows the caster to move through even the most tangled, thorny
brush as if they were on an open road. For each additional point of magnitude,
an additional person can accompany them.</p>"

Countermagic,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Instant,"<p>This spell is cast in advance and sits dormant until a hostile spell attacks
the recipient. At this point, the Countermagic spell fires off. As long as
Countermagic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s magnitude, the
target spell does not take effect.  After the Countermagic tries to block a
spell, successfully or not, it ends.</p>"
Cover Blind Side,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,personal,,"<p>For the duration of the spell, the target can react to attacks from behind or

any additional reactions.</p>"
Create Charms,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Permanent,"<p>A charm is a physical item that stores one or more Personal Magic spells. A
charm could be a necklace that holds a Befuddle 4 spell; a sword etched with
runes that holds a Weapon Enhance 2 spell; or even a sheet of paper with a poem
written on it that, when held against the skin, provides a Protection 1
spell.</p> <p>To create a charm a character must possess both the spell they
wish to store and Create Charm at the same or greater magnitude.</p> <p>The item
which going to hold the charm within close range of the caster for the length of
the casting.</p> <p>If the caster spends one growth point at the time of
creation, the spell within the charm is reusable. Otherwise once the spell is
cast the charm is dispelled.</p> <p>A spell stored in a charm uses the wielder’s
Personal Magic Casting skill and the wielder’s magic points.</p> <p>The time
taken to create a single-use charm is one hour per point of the magnitude of the
spell; Reusable charms take three hours per point of magnitude to create.</p>
<p>Charms are mundane items.  Breaking the item dispels the charm.</p>"
Create Magic Point Store,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Permanent,"<p>This spell allows the caster to create an item that has magic point storing
capabilities. Magic Point Stores allow the owner to have a pool of magic points
in addition to their own.</p> <p>Typically, crystals, due to their physical
toughness, make good stores. This spell can also be combined with an existing
charm, such as a sword with Weapon Enhance 2 stored in it, to provide a pool of
magic points to cast the spell from. In-game terms treat anything enchanted with
this spell as unbreakable.</p> <p>Magic point stores take one hour per magic
point stored in them to create.</p> <p>The caster must fill the item with their
magic points as part of the spell. The number of magic points put into the item
at the time of casting becomes the maximum.</p> <p>By default, when used, the
stored magic points do not regenerate and when all used up the spell ends. If
the caster spends one growth point while creating the store, it is reusable, and
the caster can refill the store using their magic points.</p> <p>If the item
containing the store becomes damaged or destroyed, the magic points are released
harmlessly into the surrounding area.</p>"
Create Potion,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Permanent,"<p>Potions are liquids that store one or more Personal Magic spells.  The
magnitude of the Create Potion spell needs to equal or exceed the total of the
magnitude of the spells placed into the potion.</p> <p>All potions are one use.
They must be drunk in one swift gulp to work.</p> <p>The potion automatically
works and doesn’t incur a cost in magic points to the person who is drinking
it.</p> <p>If multiple spells are placed in the potion, they are all cast on the
drinker when the potion is drunk.</p> <p>Drinking the potion takes place on the
drinker’s Athletics skill, if the timing is important such as when determining
combat order.</p> <p>The potion costs the enchanter magic points. They must know
the spell at the magnitude enchanting at, with the magic points of the spell(s)
placed into the potion.</p> <p>There is an associated cost of 1 Gold Ducat per
magnitude in materials, which includes the flask that contains the potion.</p>
<p>Potions take one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell(s) stored to
create.</p> <p>An airtight container must be used to store a potion, or it
evaporates, losing one point of magnitude per week.</p>"
Create Scroll,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Permanent,"<p>This spell allows the caster to create a written version of the spell for use
later. Either to impart knowledge of the spell to a trainee or as a reference
when casting the spell in the field.</p> <p>The caster must be able to read and
write in some form of written language, which is represented by having a
Language skill of over 80%.  They must also pay for the special inks and scroll
paper (1 Gold Ducat per point of magnitude).</p> <p>The trainee must be able to
read the language that the scroll uses. Once every three months they may study
the scroll, which takes one day per point of spell, and then make a Language
skill test. If successful, they spend the normal growth cost to learn the spell.
If they roll a critical they half that cost, to the nearest whole unit. If they
fumble, they can never learn the spell from that scroll, it is beyond their
understanding.</p> <p>To directly cast a spell from the scroll, the caster must
be able to read the language the scroll uses. Then cast the spell as normal.
Casting is much slower than if the caster is casting the spell from memory.
First, the caster reads the spell out loud and then harnesses and shapes the
magical energies. Therefore, no matter what their normal casting skill, the
spell takes an entire combat round to cast, and fires off at the end of the
combat round.</p> <p>In both cases, once learnt or cast, unless the original
writer spends one growth point at the time of creation to make the scroll
reusable, the ink fades, and the scroll crumbles to dust.</p>"
Cushion Fall,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,,"<p>The successful casting of this spell eliminates all falling damage for the
recipient for the duration of the spell.</p>"
Darkwall,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,Area (5m),"<p>Light sources within a Darkwall area shed no light, and normal sight ceases
to function. Other senses such as a bat’s sonar and night vision (see chapter 11
Creatures) function normally.</p> <p>The caster may move the Darkwall 15 metres
per combat round if they concentrate on the spell.</p>"
Demoralise,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,Resist (Persistence),"<p>This spell creates doubt and uncertainty into the very heart and soul of the
target. The target of this spell has all combat skills halved and may not cast
offensive spells. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the target
will try to avoid fighting and will either run or surrender. The Fanaticism
spell automatically cancels the effects of this spell, and vice versa.</p>"
Detect (Type),PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,personal,Concentration,"<p>This description covers a family of spells that all operate similarly,
allowing the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its range.
Any Detect spell is stopped by a thick substance, such as metal, earth or stone,
at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic, though the caster
will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its precise location)
and that Countermagic is protecting it. The separate Detect spells are listed
below, and each must be learned separately.</p> <p><i>Detect Enemy:</i> Gives
the location of the nearest creatures that intend to harm the caster.</p>
<p><i>Detect Magic:</i> Gives the location of the nearest magic item, magical
creature or active spell.</p> <p><i>Detect Species:</i> Each Detect Species
spell will give the location of the nearest creature of the specified species.
Examples of this spell include Detect Goblin, Detect Rhino and Detect Elf.</p>
<p><i>Detect Substance:</i> Each Detect Substance spell will give the location
of the nearest substance of the specified type. Examples of this spell include
Detect Coal, Detect Gold and Detect Wood</p>"
Dispel Magic,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Instant,"<p>This spell will attack and eliminate other spells. Dispel Magic will
eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its magnitude, starting with
the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell
(because the spell’s magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end.
Dispel Magic cannot partially dispel spells, so a target under the effects of a
spell whose magnitude is higher than that of Dispel Magic will not have any
spells currently affecting it eliminated.</p>"
Disruption,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,"Instant, Resist (Resilience)","<p>Disruption pulls a target’s body apart. On a failed Resilience skill test,
the target will suffer 1D4 points of damage per point of magnitude, ignoring any
armour points.</p>"
Drive Out Spirit,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,"Instant, Resist (Persistence)","<p>This spell excommunicates a spirit that is either covertly or dominantly,
possessing a character or physical location. The spirit resists eviction from
its host using its Persistence, with a penalty of -10% for every magnitude point
of the spell. If the spirit fails the test, it goes back to the Spirit
World.</p>"
Dull Weapon,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,,"<p>This spell works on any weapon. For every point of magnitude, it reduces the
damage dealt by the target weapon by two points. This spell does not affect the
damage inflicted by the damage bonus of the user.</p>"
Enhance (Skill),PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,,"<p>Like Detect (Type), this includes several different spells, each of which
affects a different non-combat skill.  For each point of magnitude, the
recipient gains +10% to any skill test using the Enhanced skill.  Alternatively,
for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one
more target.  How the caster allocates this magnitude between bonuses and
targets is up to the caster, providing each bonus are in multiples of 10%, and
the total of bonuses equals the spells magnitude x 10%.</p> <p>For example,
Ethelred may have Enhance (Deception) 5.  He could cast it all on himself to
give a whopping +50% to their Deception or could cast it on himself and an ally,
giving himself +30% and their ally +20%. If in a larger group, he could even
cast it on 5 allies, each of whom would gain +10% to their Deception skill.</p>
<p>The most common spells of this type are:</p> <ul> <li><i>Enhance
(Deception)</i>, often used by thieves.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Trade)</i>, used by
merchants.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Influence)</i>, used by lawyers, con-artists and
officers.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Resilience)</i>, used by warriors.</li>

Extinguish,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Instant,"<p>This spell instantly puts out fires. At magnitude 1 it can extinguish a
flame, magnitude 2 a small fire, magnitude 3 a large fire and magnitude 4 will
put out an inferno.</p>"
Fanaticism,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,,"<p>The target of this spell will have close combat and unarmed combat skills
increased by +20% but may not attempt  to  cast spells. Also, for the duration
of the spell, the target has a +50% bonus to any Persistence test. The
Demoralise spell and vice versa automatically cancel the effects of this
spell.</p>"
Farsight,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,Concentration,"<p>Each point of this spell extends the caster’s field of vision by twenty
metres as long as they maintain their concentration.  Although they can see
small details at a distance, this spell does not let the caster see through
walls or other obstructions.</p>"
Firearrow,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,Touch,"<p>Casting this spell on a missile weapon will allow it to fire magical missiles
of flame. When one of these missiles hits a target, it deals 1D10 points of
magical fire damage. Since the Firearrow does magical damage, it affects
creatures that are immune to normal damage. A target remains on fire once hit,
taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat
action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them.
A missile weapon under the effects of Firearrow cannot benefit from Multimissile
or Speedart</p>"
Fireblade,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,4,TRUE,personal,Touch,"<p>For the duration of the spell, the target weapon deals an additional 1D10
magical fire damage as well as its normal damage. One struck by the weapon
remains on fire, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they
spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts
Extinguish on them. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from
Weapon Enhance. Since Fireblade does magical damage, it damages creatures immune
to normal damage.”</p>"
Fist of Gold,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,,"<p>Each point of magnitude allows the caster to make one extra unarmed attack.
These attacks happen in a blur of motion as soon as the spell fires (i.e. when
the spell takes effect), instead of the normal combat order that the character’s
attacks happen on. An attack roll is made separately for each attack.</p>"
Frostbite,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,personal,"Instant, Resist (Resilience)","<p>This attack spell allows the caster to freeze their opponent, dealing 1D8
points of damage, ignoring any armour points. Magical protection that protects
against cold damage can block this effect, but mundane items (such as severe
weather gear) are ineffective.</p>"
Glue,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,"Area, Touch","<p>This spell covers an area of one centimetre square for each magnitude with
extremely sticky glue. If a creature steps on the glue, it must make an
Athletics roll vs. the magnitude x 10% to avoid being stuck for one round. On
subsequent rounds, it must make the same roll to break free. This spell can also
make conventional repairs, for example repairing a broken sword, with magnitude
x 10% being the chance that the item won’t break again if used in circumstances
that would cause it to.</p>"
Harden,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,personal,Touch,"<p>This spell makes a target item unbreakable for the duration of the spell.
Therefore, weapons with this spell cast on them will not break when a fumble
occurs in combat, and it allows items that are normally too brittle to be
wielded in combat to be used as improvised weapons.</p>"
Heal,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,"Instant, Touch","<p>For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one hit
point to damage to either themselves or another target.</p> <p><i>Mortal
Wounds.</i> A magnitude 6 or higher Heal spell will heal a mortal wound (any
damage that takes the character to zero hit point or less) instantly, restoring
them to one hit point.</p> <p><i>Curing Disease or Poison.</i> At magnitude 5 or
higher , a Heal spell will also cure any single poison or disease affecting the
target. Lost hit points are restored normally, but any other damage caused by
the poison or disease, such as characteristic loss, will not be restored.</p>
<p>This spell can not be used to bring characters who are dead back to life.</p>"
Hinder (Skill),PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,personal,"Ranged, Resist (Persistence)","<p>Like Enhance (Skill), this is several different spells, each of which affects
a different skill.  For each point of the magnitude of the spell, the target
gains a -10% penalty to the next skill test using the affected skill.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the
caster can affect one more target.  The bonuses and targets are allocated as
necessary, provided each penalty is in multiples of 10%, and the total of
bonuses equals the spell’s magnitude x 10%.  If used in this way, each target is
affected separately; if one target succeeds in resisting the spell, other
targets may fail and be affected.</p> <p>The most common spells of this type are
as follows.</p> <ul> <li><i>Hinder (Perception),</i> often used by thieves.</li>
<li><i>Hinder (Trade),</i> used by the nastier traders.</li> <li><i>Hinder

Ignite,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,personal,Instant,"<p>Ignite will set fire to anything flammable within range, creating a flame. If

Ironmind,PmL84WZU2luOrJSw,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,3,TRUE,personal,,"<p>This spell hardens the resolve of the recipient for its duration. The spell
