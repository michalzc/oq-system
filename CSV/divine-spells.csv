converting their magical energy into magic points which are then available to
the target. Once cast on a subject, Absorption will attempt to absorb the
effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells
that are already affecting a character. The effects of Absorption depend on the
relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Absorption

eliminate any spell (because the spell’s magnitude is too high), then its
effects immediately end and it will dispel no more spells.</p> <p>The caster can
also target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell. It will work
successfully as long as Dismiss Magic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target

slopes at any given time but will be completely ignorant about the ocean.</p>

being by using this spell. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is
immaterial.</p> <p>This spell forces a possessing spirit into Spirit Combat. The
caster uses his Religion (Own) as the attacking skill in the opposed contest, as
this represents the strength of their faith. If the caster is successful in
defeating the spirit, it is cast out of the victim and flees. If the caster

<p>Time works differently in the worlds of mythology, perhaps no longer being a
workable concept, but for where time is important, in the Real World, the

away in the Mythic World.</p> <p><i>For example,</i> Ethelred uses this spell to
travel to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor to ask him in person for help in
the Real World against the invading Burning Horde. Once his business has
finished there, he decides to stay and linger enjoying the delights of the
Divine Court. Months pass, or so it seems, until Ethelred loses track of how
many Imperial Banquets he has enjoyed. One morning, instead of waking up in his
crystal room with its bed made of satin sheets, in the palace, he awakes in the
Real World Temple of the Celestial Emperor in one of the initiates beds, a
rather rude affair with rougher linen sheets. He asks the passing novice how
long he has been away and finds out that it’s only a day after he passed through
the gate when he cast the spell.</p> <p>It is also possible to get trapped in
the Mythic World (for example, through getting captured by magical powers) in

the Squire accompanies Ethelred to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor. While

Reflection depend on the relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming
spell – see the Reflection Results table for more details.</p> <p>Reflection is
incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block</p> <table>

Resurrect,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,5,TRUE,divine,"Concentration (Special), Instant, Touch","<p>The body of the deceased must be present and must be whole. If the target
died due to disease or poison, the recipient returns to life cured.</p> <p>This
spell summons the deceased spirit to return its former body. Taking minutes
equal to the target’s totalled Characteristics to take effect, during which time
the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. If interrupted, the spell
fails. When the spell is successful, the dead character returns to life with one
hit point.</p> <p>Resurrect must be cast within days equal to the POW of the
deceased. Casting the spell after this point results in the magic automatically
failing.</p>"
Rout,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,3,TRUE,divine,,"<p>When aimed at a body of warriors, of no more than one hundred persons, they
must make a Persistence roll or immediately lose all cohesion as a unit and
rout. Routing units move at double movement, away from the caster, to ideally a
place of safety.  They will not defend themselves but will attack any enemy
units that get in their way, to get through them to their place of safety.</p>"
See Past,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,divine,"Area, Concentration","<p>When cast on a 10m area, the caster, as long as they concentrate, can see the
area as it was in any past point of time they wish.  They still need to make
successful Perception rolls to notice details, such as important clues, and they
cannot interact with the scene they see in any way, shape or form.</p>"
Shield,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,FALSE,divine,"Duration (15), Progressive","<p>This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point
of magnitude gives the caster one Armour Point and provides a +10% bonus to any
tests the caster may make to resist malign magical effects. A magnitude 4 Shield
spell provides the caster with +4 AP and a +40% bonus against malign spells, for
instance. These effects are cumulative with other spells, as well as any
physical armour the caster is wearing. Shield is incompatible with Absorption,
Reflection and Spirit Block.</p>"
Soul Sight,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,divine,"Common, Duration (15), Touch","<p>This spell allows the recipient to see the POW aura of anyone they looks at,
enabling them to discern that creature’s current magic points, as well as the
nature of any active spells or enchanted items the creature is carrying. It also
allows the recipient to see into the Spirit World.</p>"
Stink Bomb,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,divine,Resist (Resilience),"<p>Upon being targeted by this spell, the victim becomes covered in a tightly
fitting cloak of noxious smelling gas for 1D6 rounds. Each round the victim must
make a Resilience test or take 1D4 damage. If the resistance test result is
fumbled, the character is unconscious for the remaining duration of the spell
from being knocked out by the smell.  All Influence tests and other social
interactions are at -20% for the duration of the spell.</p>"

Shield.</p>"
Sun Disc,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,divine,"Ranged, Resist (Dodge)","<p>Upon casting this spell, the Caster projects a disc of blinding light from
their hand. Targets in the path of the disc are blinded for 1D4 hours, unless
they pass their Dodge skill test. Its warming effect melts ice upon contact,
even magical ice, if under three magnitude in power, and gives anyone it touches
+50% resistance versus cold.</p>"
Sunspear,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,4,TRUE,divine,"Ranged, Resist (Dodge)","<p>This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast, a shaft of light
two metres wide streaks from the sky to blast a single target, who must be
visible to the caster. If the target does not dive out of the way, the blazing
light will burn it for 4D6 damage. Armour points are not effective against this
damage, and it counts as both magical and fire damage.</p>"
Sureshot,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,TRUE,divine,"Duration (15), Ranged","<p>When cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock),
firing it triggers the spell. Unless the wielder of the weapon rolls an
automatic failure or a fumble, the missile hits successfully (though it may be
dodged or parried). So long as the target is within the maximum range of the
weapon, the missile will strike home, regardless of concealment or any other
factors. Attempts to parry or dodge the missile suffer a –20% penalty.</p>
<p>Combining Sureshot with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart does not work,
since Sureshot will always take precedence in such cases.</p>"
Thunder’s Voice,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,divine,,"<p>This spell grants the caster a loud voice of command which gives the caster
+20% added to their Influence skill, heard at up to 200 metres.</p>"
Touch of Death,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,4,TRUE,divine,"Instant, Resist (Persistence), Touch","<p>The caster must touch their victim, and on a failed Persistence test, the
victim falls dead. This incredibly powerful spell is available to only members
of religions whose deity wields the power of death itself. Usually, to redress
the balance, where a person who by all rights should be dead is still alive.</p>"
Treasury,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,4,TRUE,divine,Duration (1d),"<p>This spell creates a secure room, for one day, to store valuables.  All the
entrances are locked and only the caster can come in and out without setting off
a magical alarm that they can hear, no matter how far away from the room they
are.</p>"
True (Weapon),dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,3,TRUE,divine,"Duration (8h), Ranged","<p>When cast on the specified type of weapon, this spell doubles that weapon’s
normal damage dice. Other modifiers, such as Damage Modifier, are not affected.

result.</p>"
Ward Camp,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,2,TRUE,divine,"Area, Duration (8h)","<p>This spell protects a camp with an area of 50 meters squared.  Anyone
crossing the invisible boundary of the spell takes 1D10 damage and sets off a
magical alarm that immediately awakens everyone within the camp.  The Ward stays
in place, even after it has been crossed, for the full duration of the
spell.</p>"
Wax Effigy,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,4,TRUE,divine,Resist (Persistence),"<p>This spell enchants a small wax representation of the intended victim. Spells
can be cast at the effigy and affect the victim, despite the distance between
the effigy and the victim. The caster need not have seen/met the victim, since
it is the power of their god that is providing the link.  Once a day, the victim
can be caused physical harm by driving pins into the effigy, at 1D4 damage per
pin. The caster can attempt to kill the victim outright by breaking off the head
of the effigy.  In this case, the victim gets a Persistence roll to avoid death.
On a failed Persistence test, the victim dies. On a successful Persistence roll,
the effigy no longer has any power over the victim.</p>"
Whirlwind,dbvkv9rUDY2YT8qS,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,1,FALSE,divine,"Duration (15m), Progressive","<p>Each point of magnitude of this spell whips up a whirlwind capable of
carrying 20 SIZ in its whirling vortex. Each round the whirlwind moves ten
metres per point, in a random direction (use a D8 to determine the direction,
with 1 being North and 5 being South, progressing clockwise around the
directions). For each point of magnitude the whirlwind is 10 metres tall.</p>
<p>If the whirlwind hits a character, make a Dodge roll to avoid being caught up
in it. Characters caught are whipped off their feet, 1D6 metres into the vortex.
