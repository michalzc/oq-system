Teleport,9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,"Instant, Resist (Dodge)","<p>Teleport allows a sorcerer to move their self or a target, instantaneously,
to anywhere within the range of the spell, as long as the destination can be
directly observed (Sense Projection spells allow the Caster to ‘see’ locations
beyond the physical line of sight), there is solid footing, and no objects bar
their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell automatically fails.
The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per point of
magnitude.</p>"
Time Travel (Time Period),9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,Instant,"<p>This spell transports the caster and creatures (of SIZ 12-18) equal to the
magnitude of the spell to a named time era via a time tunnel that opens up and
instantly sucks them through to their destination.  The duration of the spell is
the time that the caster and group jump forward or backwards through time.</p>
<p>Sorcerers usually have some knowledge about the time period they are
travelling to and use an Anchor, a landmark such as a bronze statue, that exists
in both the original and destination time period. If they are travelling blind
without such an Anchor, the casting roll is at -25%, and the effects of a
fumbled roll are even more catastrophic than the examples below suggest.</p>
<p>If the spell casting is failed, the caster and group still travel, but they
end up in the wrong location (1D10 Km away from the anchor point) and time (1D10
time units away, the length of the time unit depends on duration, e.g. if the
duration was in days, the time unit is days).</p> <p>If the spell casting is
fumbled, catastrophic events occur.  Here are some example events, the creative
Referee is encouraged to create more:</p> <p>A guardian creature from the Other
World emerges through the portal and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close
the portal.</p> <p>The sorcerer, and all within 10m of them, is sucked through
the portal which then promptly closes. The sorcerer is so befuddled that they
cannot remember the spell for D20+D4 hours.</p> <p>As above, but the sorcerer
and party arrive in a completely different Time Era or even an Alternative
Reality.</p> <p>Sorcerers with this spell can “change” time freely without
having to worry about unintentional “butterfly effect” changes or any
alterations in their own existence or memory from changing “their” past.
However, regular use risks the catastrophic effects of a fumble.</p>"
Treat Wounds,9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,systems/oq/assets/icons/magic-swirl.svg,,FALSE,9nSgoZ4l88FtYgms,"Instant, Touch","<p>This spell must be cast upon a wounded character. It dramatically accelerates
the natural healing rate of the target.  For every point of magnitude of this
spell the caster can repair one hit point per combat round, for the duration of
the spell.</p> <p>The spell cast at magnitude 6 instantly heals mortal wounds,
bringing the character’s hit point total to one.</p> <p>This spell does not
treat disease or poison. See Remove Disease and Poison Antidote,
respectively.</p>"
