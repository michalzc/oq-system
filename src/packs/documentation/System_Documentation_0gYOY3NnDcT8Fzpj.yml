        <h2>Character</h2><h3>Character creation</h3><p>When a new Character
        actor is created, all the skills from the Basic Skills compendium are
        copied.</p><h4>Characteristics</h4><p>Characteristics can be updated
        using the Characteristics dialogue box, the 'cog' icon on the
        Characteristics panel. It calculates the points, as described in the
        rules. Characteristics can be rolled, all or
        individual.</p><h5>Mod</h5><p>Mod is a workaround for tracking temporary
        modifications. For characteristics it is simply added to the final
        value.</p><h4>Attributes</h4><p>Attributes are calculated from
        characteristics. Only mods can be updated in the attributes dialogue. It
        works in the same way as above.</p><header class="journal-page-header"

        <h1>Skills</h1><p>The skill sheet includes a 'skill formula' field that
        utilizes the roll data provided by the actor to compute its total value
        once assigned to the actor. For instance, '@str+@dex' would evaluate to
        the sum of the Strength and Dexterity characteristics, which serve as
        default values.</p><p>Upon assignment to an actor, the advancement field
        becomes visible, allowing the user to input skill advancements. The
        total value will then consist of the default value calculated from the
        formula in addition to any advancements made by the user. The
        advancement field is also visible on the actor sheet within the skills
        listing. This allows for convenient access and modification of skill
        advancements directly from the actor's skill section.</p><p>The 'mod'
        field operates with a slight variation. Instead of being directly added
        to the skill value, it functions as an additional modifier provided to
        the roll dialog. This modifier can be adjusted before initiating the
        roll.</p><p>Below the skill name, the skill's <em>slug</em> is visible.
        This simplified name serves as a reference in rolls (accessible in the
        <em>skills</em> collection) and can also be used as the value for the
        corresponding skill field on the weapon
        sheet.</p><h1>Weapons</h1><p>When a weapon is not attached to an actor,
        the skill field appears as a text input for the skill <em>slug</em>.
        Once attached to an actor, it transforms into a combo box displaying a
        list of the actor's skills. If the actor possesses a skill with the
        previously entered <em>slug</em>, that skill will be automatically
        selected upon attachment to the actor.</p><p>The skill mod field
        functions similarly to the skill mod. It does not directly augment the
        weapon's skill value but is instead supplied to the roll dialog as an
        extra modifier. If the corresponding skill's mod is also configured,
        then the more significant modifier is selected, adhering to the rules of
        the game.</p><p>The damage formula can be a roll formula and may include
        the actor's roll data. It is unnecessary to directly incorporate the
        actor's damage modifier, as it will be automatically included if the
        'Include DM' checkbox is selected.</p><h1>Special Ability</h1><p>Similar
        to skills, a special ability features a formula field where the actor's
        roll data can be utilized. Unlike skills, it does not possess
        advancements or mods. Additionally, it includes a damage formula akin to
        weapons.</p><p>Primarily designed for use with NPCs, special abilities
        can also be assigned to characters if needed.</p>

        <h1>Initiative</h1><p>On the character sheet, within the 'Combat' tab,
        and on the NPC sheet, located in the 'Combat' section, there is a combo
        box containing a list of skills, weapons, and special abilities that can
        be selected as a base for initiative during combat. Adjacent to this box
        is a field designated for an additional modifier.</p><p>Initiative
        calculations solely consider the values of the chosen skill or special
        ability without incorporating mods. Any additional modifiers can be
        specified in the corresponding field.</p><h1>Combat Tracker</h1><p>In
        this version, the combat tracker requires manually rerolling initiative
        every turn. At the end of each round, the Game Master (GM) must click
        the 'Reset Initiative' button on the Combat Tracker. Subsequently, both
        players and the GM (for monsters and NPCs) update their initiative
        values, if necessary. Once completed, the GM can then click the 'Reroll
        Initiative' button and proceed to the next round.</p>
