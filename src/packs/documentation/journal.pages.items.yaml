  content: <h1>Skills</h1><p>The skill sheet includes a 'skill formula' field that
    utilizes the roll data provided by the actor to compute its total value once assigned
    to the actor. For instance, '@str+@dex' would evaluate to the sum of the Strength
    and Dexterity characteristics, which serve as default values.</p><p>Upon assignment
    to an actor, the advancement field becomes visible, allowing the user to input
    skill advancements. The total value will then consist of the default value calculated
    from the formula in addition to any advancements made by the user. The advancement
    field is also visible on the actor sheet within the skills listing. This allows
    for convenient access and modification of skill advancements directly from the
    actor's skill section.</p><p>The 'mod' field operates with a slight variation.
    Instead of being directly added to the skill value, it functions as an additional
    modifier provided to the roll dialog. This modifier can be adjusted before initiating
    the roll.</p><p>Below the skill name, the skill's <em>slug</em> is visible. This
    simplified name serves as a reference in rolls (accessible in the <em>skills</em>
    collection) and can also be used as the value for the corresponding skill field
    on the weapon sheet.</p><h1>Weapons</h1><p>When a weapon is not attached to an
    actor, the skill field appears as a text input for the skill <em>slug</em>. Once
    attached to an actor, it transforms into a combo box displaying a list of the
    actor's skills. If the actor possesses a skill with the previously entered <em>slug</em>,
    that skill will be automatically selected upon attachment to the actor.</p><p>The
    skill mod field functions similarly to the skill mod. It does not directly augment
    the weapon's skill value but is instead supplied to the roll dialog as an extra
    modifier. If the corresponding skill's mod is also configured, then the more significant
    modifier is selected, adhering to the rules of the game.</p><p>The damage formula
    can be a roll formula and may include the actor's roll data. It is unnecessary
    to directly incorporate the actor's damage modifier, as it will be automatically
    included if the 'Include DM' checkbox is selected.</p><h1>Special Ability</h1><p>Similar
    to skills, a special ability features a formula field where the actor's roll data
    can be utilized. Unlike skills, it does not possess advancements or mods. Additionally,
    it includes a damage formula akin to weapons.</p><p>Primarily designed for use
    with NPCs, special abilities can also be assigned to characters if needed.</p>
