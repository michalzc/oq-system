  content: <h1>Initiative</h1><p>On the character sheet, within the 'Combat' tab,
    and on the NPC sheet, located in the 'Combat' section, there is a combo box containing
    a list of skills, weapons, and special abilities that can be selected as a base
    for initiative during combat. Adjacent to this box is a field designated for an
    additional modifier.</p><p>Initiative calculations solely consider the values
    of the chosen skill or special ability without incorporating mods. Any additional
    modifiers can be specified in the corresponding field.</p><h1>Combat Tracker</h1><p>In
    this version, the combat tracker requires manually rerolling initiative every
    turn. At the end of each round, the Game Master (GM) must click the 'Reset Initiative'
    button on the Combat Tracker. Subsequently, both players and the GM (for monsters
    and NPCs) update their initiative values, if necessary. Once completed, the GM
    can then click the 'Reroll Initiative' button and proceed to the next round.</p>
