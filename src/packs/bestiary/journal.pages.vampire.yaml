    rules</h2><h3 id="night-vision">Night vision</h3><p>Vampires can see in the dark
    and at night as if it were day by sensing life energy.</p><h3 id="magic-point-drain">Magic
    Point Drain</h3><p>A vampire does not regenerate Hit Points or Magic Points normally.
    Instead, they must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful
    bite attack, the vampire will hang on and drain D6 Magic Points from the victim
    every round. Each drained Magic Point gives the vampire one Hit Point or Magic
    Point (vampire’s choice). When the Vampire drains the victim’s Magic Points to
    0, the victim falls unconscious, as normal, and the vampire can choose to carry
    on draining blood, except now it’s the victim’s permanent POW that is drained.</p><h3
    id="shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</h3><p>Vampires have the ability to shapeshift
    into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire (and every non-living
    item on his person) dissolves into a thin greenish fog, approximately the same
    SIZ as they were in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of
    physical damage, but cannot take any action except moving up to their MR. In mist
    form, a vampire moves at the same speed as they would normally and is unaffected
    by strong winds. Additionally, vampires still take damage from sunlight in mist
    form.</p><p>As well as the ability to transform into mist, some vampires manifest
    the ability to shapeshift into wolves and bats as well. As with the mist transformation,
    such changes take a Combat Action to perform.</p><p>Upon death, the vampire collapses
    to the ground and turns to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before
    then, it can be destroyed permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the
    only way to prevent it from turning to mist) and decapitating it.</p><h3 id="vampires-and-sunlight">Vampires
    and Sunlight</h3><p>As creatures of the night, vampires cannot stand the touch
    of natural sunlight. They take one point of damage to every hit location per round
    that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk travelling in the daylight
    hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much of their body
    as possible.</p><h3 id="holy-symbols">Holy symbols</h3><p>In the past, the holy
    icons of some religion have proved effective against vampires. Those that focus
    their energies against the undead are the most likely to be effective. It is down
    to the Referee to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire. An
    elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather
    than by human symbols of holiness. Any character presenting a holy symbol to a
    vampire as a Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire’s Resilience
    in an opposed check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Referee’s discretion,
    based on the appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test,
    the vampire loses [[/gmr 1D4]]{1D4} Hit Points (unaffected by armour or any of
    the vampire’s magic) and may not attack that character or any other character
    under the protection of Holy Symbol.</p>'
