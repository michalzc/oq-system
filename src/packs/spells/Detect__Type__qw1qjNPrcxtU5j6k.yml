    <p>This description covers a family of spells that all operate similarly,

    allowing the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its
    range.

    Any Detect spell is stopped by a thick substance, such as metal, earth or
    stone,

    at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic, though the
    caster

    will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its precise
    location)

    and that Countermagic is protecting it. The separate Detect spells are
    listed

    below, and each must be learned separately.</p> <p><i>Detect Enemy:</i>
    Gives

    the location of the nearest creatures that intend to harm the caster.</p>

    <p><i>Detect Magic:</i> Gives the location of the nearest magic item,
    magical

    creature or active spell.</p> <p><i>Detect Species:</i> Each Detect Species

    spell will give the location of the nearest creature of the specified
    species.

    Examples of this spell include Detect Goblin, Detect Rhino and Detect
    Elf.</p>

    <p><i>Detect Substance:</i> Each Detect Substance spell will give the
    location

    of the nearest substance of the specified type. Examples of this spell
    include

    Detect Coal, Detect Gold and Detect Wood</p>
