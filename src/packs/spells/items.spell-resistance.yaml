  magnitude: 1
  description: |-
    <p>This spell matches its magnitude against the magnitude of any incoming spell.
    If Spell Resistance’s magnitude is greater than the incoming spell’s, then the
    incoming spell has no effect. If the incoming spell’s magnitude is equal to or
    greater than the magnitude of Spell Resistance, then the spell affects the
    target normally.</p> <p>Unlike many protective spells, Spell Resistance remains
    in place for the entirety of its duration – spells that successfully breach the
    spell do not dispel it. However, it does not discriminate between incoming
    spells – a comrade attempting to magically heal the recipient of Spell
    Resistance must overcome it in order to successfully use a healing spell.</p>
