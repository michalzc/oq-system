  description: |-
    <p>This spell makes any one creature more fertile than normal. If it is an
    animal that has multiple offspring, then it doubles the number. For creatures
    who usually have singular births, it guarantees the conception and birth of the
    offspring.</p> <p>This spell negates the effects of any “Block Fertility”
    spell.</p>
