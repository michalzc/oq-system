  description: |-
    <p>Casting this spell on a missile weapon will allow it to fire magical missiles
    of flame. When one of these missiles hits a target, it deals 1D10 points of
    magical fire damage. Since the Firearrow does magical damage, it affects
    creatures that are immune to normal damage. A target remains on fire once hit,
    taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat
    action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them.
    A missile weapon under the effects of Firearrow cannot benefit from Multimissile
    or Speedart</p>
