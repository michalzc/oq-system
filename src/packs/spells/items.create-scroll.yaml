  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to create a written version of the spell for use
    later. Either to impart knowledge of the spell to a trainee or as a reference
    when casting the spell in the field.</p> <p>The caster must be able to read and
    write in some form of written language, which is represented by having a
    Language skill of over 80%.  They must also pay for the special inks and scroll
    paper (1 Gold Ducat per point of magnitude).</p> <p>The trainee must be able to
    read the language that the scroll uses. Once every three months they may study
    the scroll, which takes one day per point of spell, and then make a Language
    skill test. If successful, they spend the normal growth cost to learn the spell.
    If they roll a critical they half that cost, to the nearest whole unit. If they
    fumble, they can never learn the spell from that scroll, it is beyond their
    understanding.</p> <p>To directly cast a spell from the scroll, the caster must
    be able to read the language the scroll uses. Then cast the spell as normal.
    Casting is much slower than if the caster is casting the spell from memory.
    First, the caster reads the spell out loud and then harnesses and shapes the
    magical energies. Therefore, no matter what their normal casting skill, the
    spell takes an entire combat round to cast, and fires off at the end of the
    combat round.</p> <p>In both cases, once learnt or cast, unless the original
    writer spends one growth point at the time of creation to make the scroll
    reusable, the ink fades, and the scroll crumbles to dust.</p>
