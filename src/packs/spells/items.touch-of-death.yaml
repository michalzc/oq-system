  description: |-
    <p>The caster must touch their victim, and on a failed Persistence test, the
    victim falls dead. This incredibly powerful spell is available to only members
    of religions whose deity wields the power of death itself. Usually, to redress
    the balance, where a person who by all rights should be dead is still alive.</p>
