    <p>This spell summons and binds to the service of the caster an elemental from
    another plane of existence, of size dependent on the magnitude of the spell.</p>
    <p>1 = Small, 2= Medium, 3= Large, 4=Huge</p> <p>For more details on Elementals,
    see Chapter 11 ‘Creatures’.</p> <p>The elemental stays under the control of the
    Priest until killed, or the Call spell is dispelled.</p> <p>To be successfully
    cast, the spell requires an equal volume of the source material for the
    elemental. For example, before a successful summoning, a Large Undine (Water
    elemental) requires a pool of water of at least 50m3.</p>
