    <p>When aimed at a body of warriors, of no more than one hundred persons, they
    must make a Persistence roll or immediately lose all cohesion as a unit and
    rout. Routing units move at double movement, away from the caster, to ideally a
    place of safety.  They will not defend themselves but will attack any enemy
    units that get in their way, to get through them to their place of safety.</p>
