  description: |-
    <p>This spell can be cast on a recipient other than the caster. It allows the
    recipient to assume the magical form of the deity for the duration of the spell.
    While not quite the same as becoming the god itself, it allows the recipient to
    assume some of the powers of the deity.</p> <p>While the spell is in operation,
    the recipient gains:</p> <ul> <li>+20% in all the skills that the deity
    teaches.</li> <li>Each magnitude of the spell beyond the first allows the
    recipient to learn and cast one point of the deity’s Divine or Personal Magic
    for the duration of the spell. Divine Magic is one use, and Personal Magic must
    be paid for from the recipients’ magic points. </li> <li>The recipient knows
    anything the deity would know.</li> <li>This is an exceptionally powerful spell,
    whose use and knowledge automatically puts the sorcerer on the enemy list of the
    deity’s cult, should they find out that the sorcerer knows how to Godform their
    god.</li> </ul> <p>If the spell is fumbled, one of the following events, or one
    similar from the Referee’s fertile imagination, occurs: </p> <ul> <li>The deity
    sends one of its guardians, an Otherworld servant, to exact divine vengeance
    upon the sorcerer.</li> <li>The deity transports the sorcerer and all ‘helpers’
    to their court in the Houses of the Holy to explain themselves.</li> <li>The
    deity tells a local priest of the sorcerer’s heresy and makes it clear that it
    is their temple’s job to exact revenge on their deity’s behalf.</li> </ul>
