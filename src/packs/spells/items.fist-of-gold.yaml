  description: |-
    <p>Each point of magnitude allows the caster to make one extra unarmed attack.
    These attacks happen in a blur of motion as soon as the spell fires (i.e. when
    the spell takes effect), instead of the normal combat order that the characterâ€™s
    attacks happen on. An attack roll is made separately for each attack.</p>
