  description: >-
    <p>Cast this spell on any close combat weapon or any unarmed attack. For
    every

    point of magnitude, it increases the chance to hit with the weapon by +10%
    and

    deals one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will
    affect

    creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The weaponâ€™s base damage remains

    non-magical. A weapon under the effects of this spell cannot benefit from

    Fireblade.</p>
