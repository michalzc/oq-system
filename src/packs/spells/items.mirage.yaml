  description: |-
    <p>This is the Sorcerersâ€™ version of Illusion.</p> <p>This spell creates an
    illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will seem real and solid unless
    the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception test, which is subject to a
    modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the viewer succeeds in a
    Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause damage if believed in, it
    can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon as a viewer disbelieves
    the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to them.</p> <p>The size
    of the illusion is also governed by the magnitude. A magnitude 1 Illusion can be
    used to create small household items, say a fake table and chair, but would not
    be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing dragon. </p> <table> <thead>
