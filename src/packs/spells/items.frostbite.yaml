  description: |-
    <p>This attack spell allows the caster to freeze their opponent, dealing 1D8
    points of damage, ignoring any armour points. Magical protection that protects
    against cold damage can block this effect, but mundane items (such as severe
    weather gear) are ineffective.</p>
