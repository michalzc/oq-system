  description: |-
    <p>When completed, the Protective Sphere will create a sphere-shaped area of
    protection with a radius in metres equal to the spell’s magnitude. If this spell
    is cast on the ground (or another immovable place), it cannot be moved. If cast
    on a vehicle (such as the bed of a wagon) or a person, it will move with the
    target.  After the sphere has been completed any one or all of the following
    spells can be added to provide the defensive capacities of the Sphere during the
    duration of the Sphere. The Sphere on its own provides no protection, that is
    down to the Resistance spells.</p> <p>Damage Resistance, Spell Resistance,
    Spirit Resistance.</p> <p>The Protective Sphere’s perimeter contains the
    benefits of its combined Resistance spell(s). The Protective Sphere only
    inhibits spells or attacks entering the circle from the outside – attacks or
    spells originating within the circle are unaffected. Thus, a Protective Sphere
    against spirits would block out outside spirits but have no effect on those
    already inside its perimeter.  A Protective Sphere against damage or spells
    would block out incoming attacks/spells but have no effect on attacks made
    within the sphere (including attacks targeting those outside the sphere).</p>
