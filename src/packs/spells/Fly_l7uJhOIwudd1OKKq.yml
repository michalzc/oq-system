  description: >-
    <p>Using this spell allows the caster (or whomever or whatever they target
    with

    the spell) to fly.  The caster may levitate objects or characters (the
    caster

    counting as one of these characters if they so wish).</p> <p>A levitated

    character may not be overloaded and must have a SIZ characteristic which is

    lower than the sorcerer’s POW characteristic.</p> <p>Objects must have an
    ENC

    lower than the sorcerer’s POW characteristic.</p> <p>Character or objects
    moved

    by this spell have a base Movement Rate of 6m. All objects and characters
    moved

    by this spell move at the spell caster’s behest, not their own.</p> <p>Each

    point of the spell’s magnitude may either be used to increase the target’s

    Movement by +2m or to target an additional object or character – but not
    both. A

    sorcerer casting this spell at magnitude 4 may fly themselves with a
    Movement of

    14m, fly themselves and a friend with a Movement of 10m each, or fly
    themselves

    and three friends with a Movement of 6m each.</p>
