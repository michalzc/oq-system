  description: |-
    <p>Each (Sense) Projection spell is a separate spell. These spells encompass the
    five base senses, but there are also variants for any unusual sensory mechanisms
    appropriate to the game world (such as sonar).</p> <p>This spell allows the
    caster to project one of their senses anywhere within the spell’s range. The
    spell forms an invisible and intangible sensor, some ten centimetres across,
    which receives the specified type of sensory input and transmits it to the
    caster. The sensor can move metres per combat round equal to the spell’s
    magnitude, directed by the sorcerer, and allows the sorcerer to use their
    Perception skill through the sensor.</p> <p>Spells can be cast through the
    sensor of some Projection spells. For instance, ranged spells require Sight
    Projection, while touch spells require Touch Projection (and likely Sight
    Projection too, so the Sorcerer can find their target efficiently).</p>
    <p>Characters using Mystic Vision can see the sensor and attack it if they wish,
    though it is only vulnerable to magic. Magical weapons and spells employed
    against the sensor will not destroy it but will instead transfer their damage
    directly to the caster.</p>
