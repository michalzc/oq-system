  description: |-
    <p>This spell creates doubt and uncertainty into the very heart and soul of the
    target. The target of this spell has all combat skills halved and may not cast
    offensive spells. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the target
    will try to avoid fighting and will either run or surrender. The Fanaticism
    spell automatically cancels the effects of this spell, and vice versa.</p>
