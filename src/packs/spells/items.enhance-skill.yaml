  magnitude: 1
  description: |-
    <p>Like Detect (Type), this includes several different spells, each of which
    affects a different non-combat skill.  For each point of magnitude, the
    recipient gains +10% to any skill test using the Enhanced skill.  Alternatively,
    for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one
    more target.  How the caster allocates this magnitude between bonuses and
    targets is up to the caster, providing each bonus are in multiples of 10%, and
    the total of bonuses equals the spells magnitude x 10%.</p> <p>For example,
    Ethelred may have Enhance (Deception) 5.  He could cast it all on himself to
    give a whopping +50% to their Deception or could cast it on himself and an ally,
    giving himself +30% and their ally +20%. If in a larger group, he could even
    cast it on 5 allies, each of whom would gain +10% to their Deception skill.</p>
    <p>The most common spells of this type are:</p> <ul> <li><i>Enhance
    (Deception)</i>, often used by thieves.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Trade)</i>, used by
    merchants.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Influence)</i>, used by lawyers, con-artists and
    officers.</li> <li><i>Enhance (Resilience)</i>, used by warriors.</li>
    <li><i>Enhance (Persistence)</i>, used by magicians.</li> </ul>
