  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to create an item that has magic point storing
    capabilities. Magic Point Stores allow the owner to have a pool of magic points
    in addition to their own.</p> <p>Typically, crystals, due to their physical
    toughness, make good stores. This spell can also be combined with an existing
    charm, such as a sword with Weapon Enhance 2 stored in it, to provide a pool of
    magic points to cast the spell from. In-game terms treat anything enchanted with
    this spell as unbreakable.</p> <p>Magic point stores take one hour per magic
    point stored in them to create.</p> <p>The caster must fill the item with their
    magic points as part of the spell. The number of magic points put into the item
    at the time of casting becomes the maximum.</p> <p>By default, when used, the
    stored magic points do not regenerate and when all used up the spell ends. If
    the caster spends one growth point while creating the store, it is reusable, and
    the caster can refill the store using their magic points.</p> <p>If the item
    containing the store becomes damaged or destroyed, the magic points are released
    harmlessly into the surrounding area.</p>
