  description: |-
    <p>Each point of magnitude allows the caster to make one extra unarmed
    attack. These attacks happen in a blur of motion as soon as the spell fires
    (i.e. when the spell takes effect), instead of the normal combat order that
    the characterâ€™s attacks happen on. An attack roll is made separately for
    each attack.</p>
