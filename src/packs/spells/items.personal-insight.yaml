    <p>This spell gives the caster or recipient a straightforward insight into a
    small question directly relevant to them, in the form of an internal
    intuition.</p> <p><i>For example</i> the question “Why can I not harm the
    creature?” would get the answer “Because your sword is not enchanted”, while
    “Why can we not harm the creature?” would not get an answer.</p>
