  description: |-
    <p>This spell enchants a small wax representation of the intended victim. Spells
    can be cast at the effigy and affect the victim, despite the distance between
    the effigy and the victim. The caster need not have seen/met the victim, since
    it is the power of their god that is providing the link.  Once a day, the victim
    can be caused physical harm by driving pins into the effigy, at 1D4 damage per
    pin. The caster can attempt to kill the victim outright by breaking off the head
    of the effigy.  In this case, the victim gets a Persistence roll to avoid death.
    On a failed Persistence test, the victim dies. On a successful Persistence roll,
    the effigy no longer has any power over the victim.</p>
