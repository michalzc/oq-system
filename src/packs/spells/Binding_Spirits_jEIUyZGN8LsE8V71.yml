    <p>If the character wants to bind a spirit, they must engage in spiritual

    combat. If they win, they can bind the spirit to an item or their person, by

    spending an additional growth point. If they fail, the spirit either flees
    to

    the Spirit World if it is a Magic or Healing spirit or possesses the caster
    if

    it is a Disease or Passion spirit.</p>
