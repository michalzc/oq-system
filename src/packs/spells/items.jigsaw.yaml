  description: |-
    <p>This spell causes the target to fall to pieces upon a failed Persistence
    roll.  The victim will still be alive but will not require food or water during
    the time the spell is in operation. When the spell ends, due to being dispelled
    or running out of duration, the victim will die unless painstakingly put back
    together beforehand.</p>
