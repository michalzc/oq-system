  magnitude: 1
  description: |-
    <p>This spell creates a portal to a named Other World. The magnitude of the
    spell is the number of creatures (of SIZ range 12-18) who can use the portal
    simultaneously.  The portal exists as long as the spell is in effect. When the
    spellâ€™s duration is reached, the portal closes instantly.</p> <p>If the spell
    casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur.  Here are some example events.
    The creative Referee is encouraged to create more.</p> <p>A malignant creature
    from that Other World emerges and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close
    the portal.</p> <p>The sorcerer and all within 10m of them are sucked through
    the portal, which then promptly closes. Worse, the Sorcerer is so befuddled that
    they cannot remember this spell for D20+D4 hours.</p> <p>The Other World, to
    which the portal is connected, invades the home reality in a 1D10 km diameter
    from the portal. The home reality protects itself by throwing up a magical
    barrier that lets things into the beachhead but not out.</p>
