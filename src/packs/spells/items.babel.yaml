  description: <p>If the target fails their Persistence roll, this spell garbles the
    language of the affected creature. The target can still think and, for the most
    part, act normally, but anything it says comes out as gibberish. Thus, a commanding
    officer would be unable to give orders to their men, and a spell caster would
    be unable to cast spells.</p>
