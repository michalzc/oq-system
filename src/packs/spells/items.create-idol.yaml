  description: |-
    <p>This spell requires an image of the caster’s god worth 100 GD, specially
    consecrated by a Priest reading from the sacred texts of the deity telling the
    tales and myths. The idol stores the god’s spells and can be used by Priest and
    Initiates to regain spells. It can be used by Lay Members to receive ‘lessons’,
    via visions, upon touching the idol.  Such visions will increase the Religion
    skill of a Lay Member by 1D10% when exposed to them.</p>
