  description: |-
    <p>Teleport allows a sorcerer to move their self or a target, instantaneously,
    to anywhere within the range of the spell, as long as the destination can be
    directly observed (Sense Projection spells allow the Caster to ‘see’ locations
    beyond the physical line of sight), there is solid footing, and no objects bar
    their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell automatically fails.
    The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per point of
    magnitude.</p>
