    <p>This spell causes a sizzling bolt of lightning to streak from the hand of the
    caster toward the target. If the bolt hits, each point of magnitude of the spell
    will cause 1D6 damage. Armour Points are not effective against this damage, and
    it counts as both magical and electrical damage.</p>
