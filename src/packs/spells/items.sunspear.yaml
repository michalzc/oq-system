  description: |-
    <p>This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast, a shaft of light
    two metres wide streaks from the sky to blast a single target, who must be
    visible to the caster. If the target does not dive out of the way, the blazing
    light will burn it for 4D6 damage. Armour points are not effective against this
    damage, and it counts as both magical and fire damage.</p>
