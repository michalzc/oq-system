  description: |-
    <p>This spell is cast in advance and sits dormant until a hostile spell attacks
    the recipient. At this point, the Countermagic spell fires off. As long as
    Countermagic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s magnitude, the
    target spell does not take effect.  After the Countermagic tries to block a
    spell, successfully or not, it ends.</p>
