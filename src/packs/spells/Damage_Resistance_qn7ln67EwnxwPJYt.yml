  description: >-
    <p>This spell protects the body of the recipient. Any incoming attack
    dealing

    damage equal to or less than the magnitude of the spell is ignored. Any
    incoming

    attack dealing more damage than the magnitude of Damage Resistance is
    unaffected

    and will deal its full damage as normal. Note, the protected character may
    still

    suffer from Knockback if applicable.</p> <p>Damage Resistance may be
    combined

    with the Divine Magic spell Shield, in which case incoming damage is
    compared to

    the Damage Resistance spell first and only encounters the Shield spell if
    the

    Damage Resistance is bypassed.</p>
