  description: |-
    <p>This spell is several spells, though they all operate in a similar fashion,
    which allows the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its
    range. This effect is stopped by a thick substance such as metal, earth or
    stone, if it is at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Absorption,
    though the caster will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its
    precise location). The separate Find spells are listed below.</p> <p>Unlike the
    Personal Magic Detect spells, the Find spells do not require concentration on
    the part of the caster – they simply function and alert them to the presence of
    whatever they locate.</p> <p><i>Find Enemy:</i> Gives the location of one
    creature who intends to harm the caster.</p> <p><i>Find Magic:</i> Gives the
    location of the nearest magic item, magical creature, or active spell.</p>
    <p><i>Find (Species):</i> Each Find Species spell will give the location of the
    nearest creature of the specified species. Examples of this spell include Find
    Goblin, Find Dwarf and Find Horse.</p> <p><i>Find Substance:</i> Each Find
    Substance spell will give the location of the nearest substance of the specified
    type. Examples of this spell include Find Coal, Find Gold and Find Wood.</p>
    <p>The Referee should provide the rough power of the detected subject (e.g.
    ‘weak magic’ or ‘rich gold lode’).</p>
