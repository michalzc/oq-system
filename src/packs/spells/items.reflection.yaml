  description: |-
    <p>This spell reflects incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment,
    redirecting the spell back at the original caster. Once cast on a subject,
    Reflection will attempt to reflect any spells cast at the target. It will not
    have any effect on spells that are already affecting a character. The effects of
    Reflection depend on the relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming
    spell – see the Reflection Results table for more details.</p> <p>Reflection is
    incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block</p> <table>
