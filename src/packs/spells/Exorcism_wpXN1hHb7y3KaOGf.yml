    <p>A Divine Magic caster can draw out a spirit currently possessing a mortal

    being by using this spell. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is

    immaterial.</p> <p>This spell forces a possessing spirit into Spirit Combat.
    The

    caster uses his Religion (Own) as the attacking skill in the opposed
    contest, as

    this represents the strength of their faith. If the caster is successful in

    defeating the spirit, it is cast out of the victim and flees. If the caster

    fails, the spirit remains in the possessed victim.</p>
