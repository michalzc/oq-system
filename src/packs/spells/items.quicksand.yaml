  description: |-
    <p>This spell creates a patch of quicksand 10m square. The earth in the area
    becomes boggy and saturated with water. On a failed Persistence roll, any
    character standing on the patch will sink into the earth, at a rate of 1 metre a
    combat round, The quicksand holds the victim firmly and only by dispelling the
    magic can they be rescued.</p> <p>Once the duration of the spell is over, the
    victim, if not on the surface, is buried under the now solid earth (see
    Suffocation rules).</p>
