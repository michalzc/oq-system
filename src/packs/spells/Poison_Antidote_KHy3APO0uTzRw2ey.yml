  description: >-
    <p>This spell counteracts an antidote to any poison. For the duration of the

    spell, it reduces any poison’s potency by its magnitude X 5. This is for the

    chance to resist the poison initially. If that resistance test is failed, it

    still reduces the poison’s effective potency by its magnitude X 5.   If cast
    on

    a person who is already affected by a poison, they get another chance to
    resist

    the poison.</p>
