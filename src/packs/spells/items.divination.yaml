  description: |-
    <p>For each point of the magnitude of this spell, the caster can ask one
    question of their deity, which they must answer to the best of their ability.  A
    deity can only answer questions it knows about, and that falls within its sphere
    of power. For example, a Mountain God will know exactly what is going on its
    slopes at any given time but will be completely ignorant about the ocean.</p>
    <p>Gods will also commonly ask for a sacrifice of an animal or precious object
    worth one gold ducat per question asked. Particularly cruel and bloodthirsty
    deities will demand blood sacrifices of sentient beings.</p> <p>Note, a weaker
    and less direct form of divination can be obtained at temples and shrines,
    without use of this spell. See Asking the Gods above.</p>
