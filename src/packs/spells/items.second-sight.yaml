  description: |-
    <p>Second Sight allows the caster to gauge the POW of every creature and magic
    item within the range. Anything that prevents normal vision stops the spell. The
    caster will know if each aura created by the illuminated POW is less than their
    POW, within three points of their POW, or greater than their POW.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Second Sight provides a +20% bonus on Perception tests to
    notice hidden magical items or hiding people or creatures. Second Sight will
    also reveal invisible entities, though only a hazy image will show (treat such
    targets as partially obscured).</p>
