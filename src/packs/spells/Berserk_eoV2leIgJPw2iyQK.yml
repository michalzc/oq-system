  description: >-
    <p>The recipient of this spell is overcome with blood-lust, causing them to

    disregard their safety and loyalties but imbuing them with tremendous
    stamina

    and combat ability.</p> <p>The recipient will automatically succeed any

    Resilience test for the duration of the spell. The recipient also
    automatically

    succeeds at any Fatigue tests and cannot be rendered unconscious. The Close

    Combat skills of the recipient receive a +50% bonus for the spell’s

    duration.</p> <p>However, the subject may not Parry, Dodge or cast any magic

    spells while under the influence of Berserk. Normally, the recipient remains
    in

    the Berserk state for the entire 15-minute duration of the spell. Still,

    Referees may allow a Berserk character to shake off the effects with a

    Persistence test modified by -50%. At the end of the spell, the recipient

    immediately becomes Fatigued.</p> <p>Berserk does not combine with
    Fanaticism –

    Berserk will always take precedence in such cases.</p>
