  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the recipient to literally see magic. By augmenting the
    recipient’s natural vision, the spell allows them to see a creature’s magic
    points, as well as enchanted items with their own magic points or spells. The
    recipient must be able to see the creature or object for this spell to work.
    Mystic Vision also allows a recipient to see into the Spirit World.</p> <p>On a
    normal success, the recipient of the spell will only know roughly how many magic
    points an object or creature has (1–10, 11–20, 21–30 and so forth). On a
    critical, they will know the exact amount. On a fumble, the Referee should give
    the player a misleading total.</p> <p>By looking at a spell’s effect, a
    recipient of Mystic Vision will automatically be aware of its magical origin
    (Divine Magic, Personal Magic, or Sorcery). By increasing the magnitude of
    Mystic Vision, the caster can learn more about what they are seeing. Compare the
    magnitude of Mystic Vision to the magnitude of any spell that the target is
    either casting or under the influence of. As long as Mystic Vision’s magnitude
    exceeds the other spell’s, the caster will be able to precisely determine the
    effects of the perceived spell, and a mental image of who cast the spell (if it
    is not obvious).</p> <p>By looking at an enchanted item, a recipient of Mystic
    Vision will automatically be aware of its gross magical effects (such as the
    types of enchantment currently on the item). Each point of magnitude of Mystic
    Vision will also determine either the invested POW (and therefore the relevant
    strength) of a particular enchantment or a particular condition laid upon an
    enchantment (Referee’s choice).</p>
