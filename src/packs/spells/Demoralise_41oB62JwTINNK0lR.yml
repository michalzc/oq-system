  description: >-
    <p>This spell creates doubt and uncertainty into the very heart and soul of
    the

    target. The target of this spell has all combat skills halved and may not
    cast

    offensive spells. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the
    target

    will try to avoid fighting and will either run or surrender. The Fanaticism

    spell automatically cancels the effects of this spell, and vice versa.</p>
