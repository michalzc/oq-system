  description: |-
    <p>Magical scrolls are written items that store Sorcery spells. All scrolls have
    an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude of spell in ingredients (for
    special inks/parchments, etc.).</p> <p>The resulting scroll is a one-use item
    which, upon a successful Sorcery Casting test, casts the spell(s) with any
    included manipulations at the magnitude that was cast on the scroll.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, upon a successful Sorcery Casting skill test, the reader of
    the scroll can learn the spell by spending the appropriate number of <i>Growth
    points</i>.</p> <p>Either way, upon the successful use of the scroll, the spell
    fades from the scroll. If the casting roll merely fails, the spell remains, but
    the reader cannot attempt to use the scroll until their Sorcery Casting skill
    increases. If the casting roll is fumbled, the spell fades from the scroll,
    without any benefit to the reader.</p>
