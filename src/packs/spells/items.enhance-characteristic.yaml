  description: |-
    <p>There are seven Enhance spells, one for each characteristic. Essentially the
    reverse of the Diminish spell, Enhance allows the Sorcerer to temporarily apply
    a bonus to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell. A
    creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this
    spell.</p> <p>Applying a bonus to POW does not increase the characterâ€™s magic
    points.</p>
