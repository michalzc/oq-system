    charm could be a necklace that holds a Befuddle 4 spell; a sword etched with
    runes that holds a Weapon Enhance 2 spell; or even a sheet of paper with a poem
    written on it that, when held against the skin, provides a Protection 1
    spell.</p> <p>To create a charm a character must possess both the spell they
    wish to store and Create Charm at the same or greater magnitude.</p> <p>The item
    which going to hold the charm within close range of the caster for the length of
    the casting.</p> <p>If the caster spends one growth point at the time of
    creation, the spell within the charm is reusable. Otherwise once the spell is
    cast the charm is dispelled.</p> <p>A spell stored in a charm uses the wielder’s
    Personal Magic Casting skill and the wielder’s magic points.</p> <p>The time
    taken to create a single-use charm is one hour per point of the magnitude of the
    spell; Reusable charms take three hours per point of magnitude to create.</p>
