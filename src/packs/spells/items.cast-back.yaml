  description: |-
    <p>This protective spell shields the caster from hostile magic and has a chance
    of sending it back to the attacking spell caster.</p> <p>Cast Back only affects
    spells that target the user specifically and have the Resist trait. Such spells
    may affect the protected character normally, but if it is resisted, the spell is
    launched back at the person who cast it, as long as its magnitude is not greater
    than the Cast Backâ€™s magnitude.</p>
