  description: >-
    <p>This spell is cast in advance and sits dormant until a hostile spell
    attacks

    the recipient. At this point, the Countermagic spell fires off. As long as

    Countermagic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s magnitude, the

    target spell does not take effect.  After the Countermagic tries to block a

    spell, successfully or not, it ends.</p>
