  description: |-
    <p>There are actually seven Tap spells, one for each characteristic. These
    devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of
    characteristic points, transforming them into magic points for their own
    use.</p> <p>The caster must make contact with the target, either physically or
    through Touch Projection, in order to Tap it – therefore the spell cannot be
    used on incorporeal creatures, such as spirits.</p> <p>Tap will only work if its
    magnitude is equal to, or greater than, the target’s specified characteristic.
    Thus, a magnitude 6 Tap Strength spell would only work on targets with a STR of
    6 or lower.</p> <p>The number of points Tapped by the spell is equal to 1D6 per
    combat round the spell is applied to the victim.</p> <p>Characteristic points
    lost to Tap are lost permanently, though the victim can raise them again through
    the normal means of increasing a characteristic. Characteristics may be tapped
    to 0, which usually involves the death of the victim (the exception being
    Charisma).</p> <p>For each characteristic point the sorcerer Taps, they will
    gain one magic point. The sorcerer is limited in the number of magic points they
    can gain through Tap; the spell can only increase their magic points to double
    their normal limit. A sorcerer may simply Tap a target and dissipate any gained
    magic points.</p> <p>If the sorcerer gains more magic points through Tap than
    their normal maximum, the points will disappear at the rate of one magic point
    per minute once the spell finishes.</p>
