  description: |-
    <p>There are seven Diminish spells, one for each characteristic. The spell will
    temporarily apply a penalty to the specified characteristic equal to the
    magnitude of the spell. The penalty applied by this spell may not reduce a
    characteristic below one, and a creature must have the characteristic in
    question to be affected by this spell.</p> <p>Diminish (STR, DEX, CON and SIZ)
    are resisted with Resilience. Diminish (INT, POW and CHA) are resisted with
    Persistence.</p> <p>Applying a penalty to POW does not reduce the characterâ€™s
    magic points.</p> <p>Note that not all uses of this spell are malicious. Thieves
    and others often value the timely use of a Diminish (SIZ) spell, as it can
    greatly enhance their ability to enter restricted areas.</p>
