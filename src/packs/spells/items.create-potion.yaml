  description: |-
    <p>Potions are liquids that store one or more Personal Magic spells.  The
    magnitude of the Create Potion spell needs to equal or exceed the total of the
    magnitude of the spells placed into the potion.</p> <p>All potions are one use.
    They must be drunk in one swift gulp to work.</p> <p>The potion automatically
    works and doesn’t incur a cost in magic points to the person who is drinking
    it.</p> <p>If multiple spells are placed in the potion, they are all cast on the
    drinker when the potion is drunk.</p> <p>Drinking the potion takes place on the
    drinker’s Athletics skill, if the timing is important such as when determining
    combat order.</p> <p>The potion costs the enchanter magic points. They must know
    the spell at the magnitude enchanting at, with the magic points of the spell(s)
    placed into the potion.</p> <p>There is an associated cost of 1 Gold Ducat per
    magnitude in materials, which includes the flask that contains the potion.</p>
    <p>Potions take one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell(s) stored to
    create.</p> <p>An airtight container must be used to store a potion, or it
    evaporates, losing one point of magnitude per week.</p>
