    <p>There are seven Enhance spells, one for each characteristic. Essentially
    the

    reverse of the Diminish spell, Enhance allows the Sorcerer to temporarily
    apply

    a bonus to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell.
    A

    creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this

    spell.</p> <p>Applying a bonus to POW does not increase the characterâ€™s
    magic

    points.</p>
