  description: >-
    <p>This spell has a chance of opening a lock equal to the spellâ€™s magnitude
    x

    20%, minus any modifiers due to the intricacy of the lock. If cast on a lock

    that has had a Lock spell cast on it, the test is an opposed test vs. the

    magnitude x 20% of the Lock spell.</p>
