  description: >-
    <p>This spell is as much a part of a temple’s foundation as is its
    cornerstone.

    It creates a sphere with a radius of ten metres per point of magnitude. The

    consecrated sphere is sacred to the caster’s god. Consecrate by itself does

    nothing to keep outsiders at bay, but the caster of the spell will know if a

    spell, spirit or someone who is not a lay member of his religion, crosses
    the

    boundaries of the Consecrate spell.</p>
