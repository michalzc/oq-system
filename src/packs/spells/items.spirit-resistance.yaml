  description: |-
    <p>This spell matches its magnitude against the POW of any spirit that comes
    into contact with the recipient. If the recipient of the caster’s  POW  the
    Spirit Resistance’s magnitude is greater than the spirit’s POW, the spirit
    cannot touch the recipient.</p> <p>A spirit unable to touch a recipient will not
    be able to attack or directly harm them, including through ranged attacks. A
    spell cast by a spirit at the recipient is blocked unless its magnitude exceeds
    the Spirit Resistance’s magnitude.</p>
