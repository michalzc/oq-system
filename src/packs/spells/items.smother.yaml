  description: |-
    <p>If successful, this spell neutralises the air surrounding the target, making
    each breath stale and worthless, depriving it of oxygen. The caster must
    concentrate each round, in order to keep the spell operating. For the duration
    of the spell, the target will be unable to breathe, essentially drowning on dry
    land.</p> <p>When the spell begins, the targetâ€™s Resilience test determines
    whether it is able to gasp in one last breath before Smother cuts off the
    surrounding oxygen supply. If the target succeeds, it may hold its breath as
    normal. If it fails, it will start drowning in the next combat round.</p>
    <p>This spell can also be used to extinguish fires, as the flames will be
    starved of oxygen. At magnitude 1, it can extinguish a Flame, magnitude 2 a
    Large Flame, magnitude 4 a Small Fire, magnitude 7 a Large Fire and magnitude 10
    it will put out an Inferno. Smother has no effect on magical fire or on
    fire-based creatures.</p>
