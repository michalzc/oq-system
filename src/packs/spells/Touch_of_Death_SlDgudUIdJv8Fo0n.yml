    <p>The caster must touch their victim, and on a failed Persistence test, the

    victim falls dead. This incredibly powerful spell is available to only
    members

    of religions whose deity wields the power of death itself. Usually, to
    redress

    the balance, where a person who by all rights should be dead is still
    alive.</p>
