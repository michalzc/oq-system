  description: |-
    <p>This spell must be cast upon a wounded character. It dramatically accelerates
    the natural healing rate of the target.  For every point of magnitude of this
    spell the caster can repair one hit point per combat round, for the duration of
    the spell.</p> <p>The spell cast at magnitude 6 instantly heals mortal wounds,
    bringing the characterâ€™s hit point total to one.</p> <p>This spell does not
    treat disease or poison. See Remove Disease and Poison Antidote,
    respectively.</p>
