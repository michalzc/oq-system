    <p>For the duration of the spell, the target weapon deals an additional 1D10

    magical fire damage as well as its normal damage. One struck by the weapon

    remains on fire, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until
    they

    spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts

    Extinguish on them. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit
    from

    Weapon Enhance. Since Fireblade does magical damage, it damages creatures
    immune

    to normal damage.‚Äù</p>
