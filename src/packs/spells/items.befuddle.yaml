  description: |-
    <p>This spell confuses and clouds the mind of its target if they fail a
    Persistence roll. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take
    non-offensive actions. The target may run if it so chooses and may dodge and
    normally parry in combat.  Any skills that have INT as a base are at -20% when
    tested while the target is under the effects of this spell.</p>
    <p>This spell is effective against humanoids and natural creatures. Other
    creatures (such as spirits or magical beasts like dragons) are not affected by
    this spell.</p>
