  description: >-
    <p>This spell causes a glowing point of light to appear on a solid
    substance. At

    its base, the spell creates an area of light one metre in radius, giving off
    the

    same illumination as a candle. Each additional point of magnitude increases
    the

    radius of effect by one metre. At magnitude 3, the brightness of the spell

    increases to that of a flaming brand at its centre. At magnitude 5, it
    increases

    to that of a camp-fire and at magnitude 10 to that of a bonfire.</p> <p>This

    spell can be cast on an opponent’s eyes. If cast on a living being, the
    spell

    also gains the Resist (Dodge) trait. If the target fails to resist it, they
    will

    suffer a penalty to all attack, parry and Dodge tests, as well as any skills

    relying upon vision, equal to five times the spell’s magnitude, until the
    spell

    ends or is dispelled.</p>
