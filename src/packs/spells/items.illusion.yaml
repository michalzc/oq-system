  description: |-
    <p>This spell creates an illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will
    seem real and solid unless the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception
    test, which is subject to a modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the
    viewer succeeds in a Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause
    damage if believed in, it can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon
    as a viewer disbelieves the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to
    them.</p> <p>The magnitude also governs the Size of the illusion. A magnitude 1
    Illusion can quite happily create small household items, say a fake table and
    chair, but would not be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing
    Dragon.</p>
