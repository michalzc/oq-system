  description: |-
    <p>This spell transports the caster and creatures (of SIZ 12-18) equal to the
    magnitude of the spell to a named time era via a time tunnel that opens up and
    instantly sucks them through to their destination.  The duration of the spell is
    the time that the caster and group jump forward or backwards through time.</p>
    <p>Sorcerers usually have some knowledge about the time period they are
    travelling to and use an Anchor, a landmark such as a bronze statue, that exists
    in both the original and destination time period. If they are travelling blind
    without such an Anchor, the casting roll is at -25%, and the effects of a
    fumbled roll are even more catastrophic than the examples below suggest.</p>
    <p>If the spell casting is failed, the caster and group still travel, but they
    end up in the wrong location (1D10 Km away from the anchor point) and time (1D10
    time units away, the length of the time unit depends on duration, e.g. if the
    duration was in days, the time unit is days).</p> <p>If the spell casting is
    fumbled, catastrophic events occur.  Here are some example events, the creative
    Referee is encouraged to create more:</p> <p>A guardian creature from the Other
    World emerges through the portal and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close
    the portal.</p> <p>The sorcerer, and all within 10m of them, is sucked through
    the portal which then promptly closes. The sorcerer is so befuddled that they
    cannot remember the spell for D20+D4 hours.</p> <p>As above, but the sorcerer
    and party arrive in a completely different Time Era or even an Alternative
    Reality.</p> <p>Sorcerers with this spell can “change” time freely without
    having to worry about unintentional “butterfly effect” changes or any
    alterations in their own existence or memory from changing “their” past.
    However, regular use risks the catastrophic effects of a fumble.</p>
