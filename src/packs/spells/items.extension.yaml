  description: |-
    <p>This spell lengthens the duration of any Divine Magic spell with the Duration
    trait. Extension, and the spell it is extending, are cast simultaneously by the
    caster – this is an exception to the normal rule that only one Divine Magic
    spell is cast during a combat round.</p> <p>Each point of magnitude of the
    Extension spell doubles the target spell’s duration. Thus, a magnitude 1
    Extension increases Breathe Water’s Duration to 30 minutes, a magnitude 2
    increases it to one hour, magnitude 3 increases it to two hours, magnitude 4
    increases it to four hours, and so on.</p>
