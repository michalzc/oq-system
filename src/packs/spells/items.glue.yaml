  description: |-
    <p>This spell covers an area of one centimetre square for each magnitude with
    extremely sticky glue. If a creature steps on the glue, it must make an
    Athletics roll vs. the magnitude x 10% to avoid being stuck for one round. On
    subsequent rounds, it must make the same roll to break free. This spell can also
    make conventional repairs, for example repairing a broken sword, with magnitude
    x 10% being the chance that the item wonâ€™t break again if used in circumstances
    that would cause it to.</p>
