  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows a caster to neutralise other spells. Neutralise Magic will
    eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its own magnitude, starting
    with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate the most
    powerful spell, then it will instead target the second-most powerful spell. As
    soon as Neutralise Magic can no longer dismiss a target’s spells, because all
    the remaining spell’s magnitudes are too high, its effects immediately end.</p>
    <p>Neutralise Magic can be fired as a Reaction, but only when another spell that
    the character wishes to counter is cast within Neutralise Magic’s range. A
    successful Neutralise Magic disrupts the other spell and nullifies it. As long
    as Neutralise Magic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell’s magnitude,
    the target spell is countered.</p>
