    <p>Using the arts of alchemy, Sorcerers can store Sorcery spells in a liquid
    known as a Potion.</p> <p>All potions have an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per
    magnitude of spell in ingredients. Multiple spells may be stored in one potion,
    with the understanding that they will all be cast when the potion is drunk at
    the magnitude that the creator originally put into the potion.</p>
