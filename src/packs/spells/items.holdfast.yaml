  description: |-
    <p>This spell causes two adjacent ten centimetres by ten centimetre surfaces
    (roughly the size of a personâ€™s palm) to commingle into one. The basic bond has
    a STR of 1. Each additional point of magnitude will either increase the STR of
    the bond by +1 or double the area affected.</p> <p>This spell can affect organic
    and inorganic substances. If the caster is attempting to bond a living being
    with this spell, the spell gains the Resist (Resilience) trait.</p>
