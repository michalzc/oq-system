  description: |-
    <p>Upon being targeted by this spell, the victim becomes covered in a tightly
    fitting cloak of noxious smelling gas for 1D6 rounds. Each round the victim must
    make a Resilience test or take 1D4 damage. If the resistance test result is
    fumbled, the character is unconscious for the remaining duration of the spell
    from being knocked out by the smell.  All Influence tests and other social
    interactions are at -20% for the duration of the spell.</p>
