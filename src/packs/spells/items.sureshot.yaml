  description: |-
    <p>When cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock),
    firing it triggers the spell. Unless the wielder of the weapon rolls an
    automatic failure or a fumble, the missile hits successfully (though it may be
    dodged or parried). So long as the target is within the maximum range of the
    weapon, the missile will strike home, regardless of concealment or any other
    factors. Attempts to parry or dodge the missile suffer a â€“20% penalty.</p>
    <p>Combining Sureshot with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart does not work,
    since Sureshot will always take precedence in such cases.</p>
