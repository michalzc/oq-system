  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to move an item of up to 3 SIZ or ENC per point
    of magnitude either towards or away from them in a straight line as if pushed
    suddenly from one direction or the other. The item does not move with
    significant enough force to inflict damage unless it is naturally damaging (a
    bottle of acid, for instance). The caster has no control over the distance
    pushed or pulled, as this depends on the location of the item and/or the surface
    on which it rests. Living creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a
    Resilience roll to resist.</p>
