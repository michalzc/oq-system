  description: |-
    <p>This spell opens a gate to a place in the Houses of the Holy associated most
    closely with the worshipper’s deity or pantheon. The worshipper may take any
    number of companions with them but must be aware that if they are not acceptable
    to the residents of the place they are going to, they may be attacked or
    expelled. Also, the companions must have some strong spiritual connection with
    the caster, such as being members of the same religion or good friends.</p>
    <p>Time works differently in the worlds of mythology, perhaps no longer being a
    workable concept, but for where time is important, in the Real World, the
    spell’s duration is the amount of time that the caster and their companions are
    away in the Mythic World.</p> <p><i>For example,</i> Ethelred uses this spell to
    travel to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor to ask him in person for help in
    the Real World against the invading Burning Horde. Once his business has
    finished there, he decides to stay and linger enjoying the delights of the
    Divine Court. Months pass, or so it seems, until Ethelred loses track of how
    many Imperial Banquets he has enjoyed. One morning, instead of waking up in his
    crystal room with its bed made of satin sheets, in the palace, he awakes in the
    Real World Temple of the Celestial Emperor in one of the initiates beds, a
    rather rude affair with rougher linen sheets. He asks the passing novice how
    long he has been away and finds out that it’s only a day after he passed through
    the gate when he cast the spell.</p> <p>It is also possible to get trapped in
    the Mythic World (for example, through getting captured by magical powers) in
    which case the character does not return form the Mythic World until they escape
    whatever power that has them in their thrall.</p> <p><i>For example,</i> Nykos
    the Squire accompanies Ethelred to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor. While
    his master is conducting his business, Nykos meets one of the Imperial
    Handmaidens and becomes beguiled by her charms. When Ethelred returns to the
    real world, after months of pleasure, Nykos remains still under the spell of the
    Imperial Handmaiden.</p>
