  description: >-
    <p>This is the Sorcerersâ€™ version of Illusion.</p> <p>This spell creates an

    illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will seem real and solid
    unless

    the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception test, which is subject to
    a

    modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the viewer succeeds in a

    Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause damage if believed in,
    it

    can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon as a viewer
    disbelieves

    the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to them.</p> <p>The
    size

    of the illusion is also governed by the magnitude. A magnitude 1 Illusion
    can be

    used to create small household items, say a fake table and chair, but would
    not

    be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing dragon. </p> <p>
