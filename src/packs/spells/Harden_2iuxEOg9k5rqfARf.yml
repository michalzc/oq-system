  description: |-
    <p>This spell makes a target item unbreakable for the duration of the spell.
    Therefore, weapons with this spell cast on them will not break when a fumble
    occurs in combat, and it allows items that are normally too brittle to be
    wielded in combat to be used as improvised weapons.</p>
