  description: >-
    <p>This spell can affect one target for every point of magnitude. It allows

    telepathy between the caster and any target, though targets will not have

    telepathy with one another. The words transmitted by telepathy must be
    whispered

    and will be heard directly in the head of the recipient, in the same
    language in

    which the caster spoke it.</p>
