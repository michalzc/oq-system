  description: |-
    <p>This spell counteracts an antidote to any poison. For the duration of the
    spell, it reduces any poison’s potency by its magnitude X 5. This is for the
    chance to resist the poison initially. If that resistance test is failed, it
    still reduces the poison’s effective potency by its magnitude X 5.   If cast on
    a person who is already affected by a poison, they get another chance to resist
    the poison.</p>
