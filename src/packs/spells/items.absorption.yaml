  description: |-
    <p>This spell absorbs incoming spells aimed at the target or their equipment,
    converting their magical energy into magic points which are then available to
    the target. Once cast on a subject, Absorption will attempt to absorb the
    effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells
    that are already affecting a character. The effects of Absorption depend on the
    relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Absorption
    Results table for more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled
    and does not affect the target.</p> <table> <caption>Absorption
    Results</caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Incoming Spell’s Magnitude is</th>
    <th>Effect</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Equal to or weaker than
    Absorption’s magnitude.</td> <td>Incoming spell absorbed and Absorption
    remains.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 or more points stronger than Absorption’s
    magnitude.</td> <td>Absorption eliminated and incoming spell takes effect.</td>
    </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>A character may not accumulate more magic points than
    his POW while Absorption is in effect – excess magic points garnered through
    Absorption simply vanish. Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and
    Spirit Block.</p>
