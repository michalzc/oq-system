  description: |-
    <p>This spell absorbs incoming spells aimed at the target or their equipment,
    converting their magical energy into magic points which are then available to
    the target. Once cast on a subject, Absorption will attempt to absorb the
    effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells
    that are already affecting a character. The effects of Absorption depend on the
    relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Absorption
    Results table for more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled
    and does not affect the target.</p>

    Results}</p> <p>A character may not accumulate more magic points than his POW
    while Absorption is in effect – excess magic points garnered through Absorption
    simply vanish. Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and Spirit
    Block.</p>
