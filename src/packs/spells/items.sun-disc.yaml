  description: |-
    <p>Upon casting this spell, the Caster projects a disc of blinding light from
    their hand. Targets in the path of the disc are blinded for 1D4 hours, unless
    they pass their Dodge skill test. Its warming effect melts ice upon contact,
    even magical ice, if under three magnitude in power, and gives anyone it touches
    +50% resistance versus cold.</p>
