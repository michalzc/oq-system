    <p>This spell excommunicates a spirit that is either covertly or dominantly,
    possessing a character or physical location. The spirit resists eviction from
    its host using its Persistence, with a penalty of -10% for every magnitude point
    of the spell. If the spirit fails the test, it goes back to the Spirit
    World.</p>
