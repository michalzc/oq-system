  description: >-
    <p>The caster uses this spell to enchant a puppet, which is the focus of the

    spell and the stand-in for the victim. The victim can use Persistence to
    resist

    the spell, and if they fail, their actions are controlled via the puppet by
    the

    caster, for the duration of the spell. The victim is aware of not being in

    control of their body but is powerless to stop it. The exception to this
    rule is

    when the victim’s life or that of a friend is in danger because of the

    Puppeteer’s commands. Then the victim is allowed another Persistence roll,
    and,

    if successful, break free of the spell’s control.</p>
