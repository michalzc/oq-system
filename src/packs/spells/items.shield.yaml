  description: |-
    <p>This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point
    of magnitude gives the caster one Armour Point and provides a +10% bonus to any
    tests the caster may make to resist malign magical effects. A magnitude 4 Shield
    spell provides the caster with +4 AP and a +40% bonus against malign spells, for
    instance. These effects are cumulative with other spells, as well as any
    physical armour the caster is wearing. Shield is incompatible with Absorption,
    Reflection and Spirit Block.</p>
