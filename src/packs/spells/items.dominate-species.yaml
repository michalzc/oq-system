  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the caster to gain control over a creature belonging to a
    specific species. If the target fails to resist the spell, it must obey the
    commands of the caster for the duration of the spell.</p> <p>The controlled
    creature shares a telepathic link with the sorcerer by which it can receive its
    orders. If the sorcerer and the creature dominated do not share a common
    language, the sorcerer can order it about, by forming a mental image of the
    actions they wish the dominated creature to perform.</p>
