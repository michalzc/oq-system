  description: |-
    <p>Dismiss Magic is used either against a general target or a specific spell and
    as a reaction when attacked with magic.</p> <p>When used against a general
    target, Dismiss Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its
    magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to
    eliminate any spell (because the spell’s magnitude is too high), then its
    effects immediately end and it will dispel no more spells.</p> <p>The caster can
    also target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell. It will work
    successfully as long as Dismiss Magic’s magnitude equals or exceeds the target
    spell’s magnitude.</p> <p>When used as a defensive reaction against incoming
    magic, as long as the attacking caster is within Dismiss Magic’s range, a
    successful Dismiss Magic disrupts the other spell and nullifies it.</p>
