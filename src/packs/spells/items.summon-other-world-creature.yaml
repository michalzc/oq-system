    <p>This spell allows the sorcerer to summon one Other World creature, per
    casting, to the mundane world. The creature is not automatically under the
    sorcerer’s control. If the summoned creature succeeds its Persistence test, it
    is free of the sorcerer’s command and, if so inclined, may be hostile to the
    sorcerer. Otherwise, it acts as if under the influence of a Dominate spell, for
    the duration of the spell.  The duration of the summon spell also determines how
    long the creature is trapped in the Mundane World.</p> <p>Example Other World
    creatures: Demons, Elementals, Spirits and Undead.</p>
