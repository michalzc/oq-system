    <p>For the duration of the spell, the recipient is entirely invisible to sight.
    They can still be heard, felt or smelled, with a -20% to Perception tests. Also,
    if the caster loses concentration, or the recipient casts a spell or makes an
    attack, the spell ends. The recipient also becomes visible immediately after the
    spell ends, so even if the caster immediately casts another Invisibility spell,
    there will be a delay between castings where the recipient is visible.</p>
