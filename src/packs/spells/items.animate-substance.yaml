  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the sorcerer to animate the substance indicated, up to one
    SIZ for every point of magnitude. The sorcerer can cause it to move about and
    interact, albeit relatively clumsily (Movement of 1m per three points of
    magnitude).</p> <p>The sorcerer’s chance to have the animated object perform any
    physical skill successfully is equal to half their own chance to perform that
    action (before any modifiers). If the appropriate Form/Set spell is cast
    immediately after this spell, the caster can perform much finer manipulation of
    the object. In this case, the animated object will use the caster’s full skill
    scores for physical activities.</p> <p>This spell can only be used on inanimate
    matter.</p>
