  description: |-
    <p>This spell allows the transmission of conscious thoughts, spell knowledge,
    runes and magic points between participants.</p> <p>Additional points of
    magnitude allow multiple sets of people to be linked together, either creating
    several separate pairs of Mindlinked people or making the Caster the central hub
    of a small Mindlink network. In the second case, only the ‘central’ character is
    linked directly to other participants.</p> <p>Mindlink must be cast upon all
    participants at the same time and is limited to consenting participants. Any
    participant in a Mindlink may use the spell knowledge and magic points of others
    they linked to without consent.</p> <p>Participants in a Mindlink have a special
    vulnerability to INT, POW, CHA and morale-affecting spells. Such a spell cast
    against any member of a Mindlink will affect all those connected, though all
    participants are entitled to defend themselves individually.</p> <p>Although
    participants in a Mindlink share magic points and conscious thought, they remain
    their own entity. Mindlink does not include hidden thoughts, memories,
    unconscious urges or permanent spell knowledge. A Mindlink participant may cast
    a spell using one of those the other participants have, but only if they have
    the necessary spell casting skill – Mindlink does not allow sharing of
    skills.</p> <p>Any participant may sever their connection to the Mindlink as a
    combat action. If any participant in Mindlink leaves the spell’s range, that
    participant has left the Mindlink.</p>
