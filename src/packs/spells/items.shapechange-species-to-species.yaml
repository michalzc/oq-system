  description: |-
    <p>Each Shapechange spell is a separate spell. Of all the spells with multiple
    variations, the Shapechange spell has the most, comprising a new spell for
    almost every combination of creatures imaginable. The spell only works on living
    things â€“ the dead or inanimate cannot be shape changed.</p> <p>The magnitude of
    the spell must be equal to or greater than the average SIZ of both specified
    species. Thus, changing a mouse (SIZ 1) into a newt (also SIZ 1) is magnitude 1.
    Changing a mouse into a lion (SIZ 19) is magnitude 10.</p> <p>If the spell is
    successful, the target will be biologically changed, gaining the STR, DEX, CON
    and SIZ of its new form. Its INT, POW and CHA are unchanged, and the target
    retains its memories and abilities (though it may be unable to use some of those
    abilities in its new form).</p>
