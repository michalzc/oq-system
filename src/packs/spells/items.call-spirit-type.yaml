    <p>Magnitude 3, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)</p> <p>This spell summons a
    single spirit of a given type from the Spirit World to do the bidding of the
    caster. The spirit resists the call by using its Persistence. If it succeeds, it
    can return to the Spirit World. Unless combined with a Binding attempt (see
    below), the spirit that fails a Persistence roll must perform one action, within
    its power, for the caster, after which it returns to the Spirit World.</p>
