    <p>Light sources within a Darkwall area shed no light, and normal sight ceases
    to function. Other senses such as a batâ€™s sonar and night vision (see chapter 11
    Creatures) function normally.</p> <p>The caster may move the Darkwall 15 metres
    per combat round if they concentrate on the spell.</p>
