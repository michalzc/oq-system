    <p>A Divine Magic caster can draw out a spirit currently possessing a mortal
    being by using this spell. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is
    immaterial.</p> <p>This spell forces a possessing spirit into Spirit Combat. The
    caster uses his Religion (Own) as the attacking skill in the opposed contest, as
    this represents the strength of their faith. If the caster is successful in
    defeating the spirit, it is cast out of the victim and flees. If the caster
    fails, the spirit remains in the possessed victim.</p>
