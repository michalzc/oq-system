  description: |-
    <p>This spell is as much a part of a temple’s foundation as is its cornerstone.
    It creates a sphere with a radius of ten metres per point of magnitude. The
    consecrated sphere is sacred to the caster’s god. Consecrate by itself does
    nothing to keep outsiders at bay, but the caster of the spell will know if a
    spell, spirit or someone who is not a lay member of his religion, crosses the
    boundaries of the Consecrate spell.</p>
