  description: |-
    <p>For the duration of the spell, the target weapon deals an additional 1D10
    magical fire damage as well as its normal damage. One struck by the weapon
    remains on fire, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they
    spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts
    Extinguish on them. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from
    Weapon Enhance. Since Fireblade does magical damage, it damages creatures immune
    to normal damage.‚Äù</p>
