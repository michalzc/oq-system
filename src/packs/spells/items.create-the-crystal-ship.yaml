    <p>From out of the air coalesces the Crystal Ship, a magical vessel that sails
    through the air to a single destination preordained by the caster. The caster
    need never have been there, but the casterâ€™s deity must know of it. The ship is
    about the size of a merchant cog and fitted with no weapons.  Although the ship
    heads steadily towards the destination, at a rate of 100 km a day, the fine
    manoeuvring of the ship is managed by the thoughts of the caster.</p>
