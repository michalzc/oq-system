  description: |-
    <p>Each point of magnitude of this spell whips up a whirlwind capable of
    carrying 20 SIZ in its whirling vortex. Each round the whirlwind moves ten
    metres per point, in a random direction (use a D8 to determine the direction,
    with 1 being North and 5 being South, progressing clockwise around the
    directions). For each point of magnitude the whirlwind is 10 metres tall.</p>
    <p>If the whirlwind hits a character, make a Dodge roll to avoid being caught up
    in it. Characters caught are whipped off their feet, 1D6 metres into the vortex.
    Each round roll a 1D6 and consult the following table.</p>
