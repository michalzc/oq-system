  description: |-
    <p>Each point of magnitude of this spell whips up a whirlwind capable of
    carrying 20 SIZ in its whirling vortex. Each round the whirlwind moves ten
    metres per point, in a random direction (use a D8 to determine the direction,
    with 1 being North and 5 being South, progressing clockwise around the
    directions). For each point of magnitude the whirlwind is 10 metres tall.</p>
    <p>If the whirlwind hits a character, make a Dodge roll to avoid being caught up
    in it. Characters caught are whipped off their feet, 1D6 metres into the vortex.
    Each round roll a 1D6 and consult the following table.</p> <table>
    <caption>Whirlwind Results</caption> <thead> <tr> <th>Roll 1D6</th>
    <th>Result</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1-2</td> <td>The character is
    carried up 1D10 metres (if already at the top), blown out of the whirlwind the
    additional height before falling to earth (taking damage).</td> </tr> <tr>
    <td>3-4</td> <td>Stay at the height they are.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5-6</td>
    <td>Fall 1D6 down in the vortex. If this takes them to the ground, they take
    falling damage.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
