  description: |-
    <p>If the caster succeeds in casting the spell, a missile weapon holds the spell
    for ten minutes. A missile under the effects of Multimissile cannot benefit from
    Firearrow or Speedart.</p> <p>When the Multimissile-enchanted missile is fired
    or thrown, one additional magical missile fires for every point of magnitude.
    Each magic missile’s attack is separate, and each does the same damage as the
    original (though they will not benefit from the character’s damage modifier).
    Magical missiles created through Multimissile will not cause critical hits,
    though the original missile can. Magical missiles created through Multimissile
    will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic.</p>
