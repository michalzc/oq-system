  description: |-
    <p>Like Enhance (Skill), this is several different spells, each of which affects
    a different skill.  For each point of the magnitude of the spell, the target
    gains a -10% penalty to the next skill test using the affected skill.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the
    caster can affect one more target.  The bonuses and targets are allocated as
    necessary, provided each penalty is in multiples of 10%, and the total of
    bonuses equals the spellâ€™s magnitude x 10%.  If used in this way, each target is
    affected separately; if one target succeeds in resisting the spell, other
    targets may fail and be affected.</p> <p>The most common spells of this type are
    as follows.</p> <ul> <li><i>Hinder (Perception),</i> often used by thieves.</li>
    <li><i>Hinder (Trade),</i> used by the nastier traders.</li> <li><i>Hinder
    (Persistence),</i> used by magicians against enemy spellcasters before casting
    spells upon them.</li> </ul>
