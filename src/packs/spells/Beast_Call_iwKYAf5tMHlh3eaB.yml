  description: >-
    <p>The Beast Call serves to attract an animal within range. When the spell
    is cast, it affects a targeted creature with a fixed INT of 7 or less. If it
    fails to resist, the creature will go to the place where the caster stands,
    and the spell effect terminates. Any barrier, immediate threat, or counter
    control, also end the effects of the spell, leaving the creature to react
    naturally.</p> <p><i>For example</i>, the Beast Call spell might cause a
    horse to turn and walk towards the spell, but a single yank of its reins by
    the rider would end the spellâ€™s effect.</p> <p>This spell is a potent aid to
    hunters and herders.</p>
