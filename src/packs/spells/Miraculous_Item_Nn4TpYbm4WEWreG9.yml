    <p>This spell allows the Caster to create items literally from nowhere. The
    size

    of the item depends upon the magnitude of the spell.</p> <table>

    <caption>Magnitude vs. Size of Miraculous Item</caption> <thead> <tr>

    <th>Magnitude</th> <th>Size of item</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr>
    <td>1</td>

    <td>Small items. Such as pots, plates, knives, and a defaced detail on a
    stone

    fresco, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Medium. Large containers such as

    wine amphorae, target shields, long swords, human-sized armour, a missing
    arm on

    a broken statue.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Large. Tower shields, broken

    doors, a missing masonry feature such as a column.</td> </tr> <tr>
    <td>4</td>

    <td>Huge. Giant armour, ruined houses, shattered towers.</td> </tr> <tr>

    <td>5</td> <td>Enormous. The broken parts of a walking castle, the ruined
    walls

    of a city.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Such items are always of the
    finest

    quality and do not break under any circumstance. For the cost of the
    magnitude

    in growth points, the item can last permanently. Otherwise, it disappears
    after

    one hour.</p>
