    <p>When cast on a 10m area, the caster, as long as they concentrate, can see the
    area as it was in any past point of time they wish.  They still need to make
    successful Perception rolls to notice details, such as important clues, and they
    cannot interact with the scene they see in any way, shape or form.</p>
