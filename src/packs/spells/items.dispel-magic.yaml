  description: |-
    <p>This spell will attack and eliminate other spells. Dispel Magic will
    eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its magnitude, starting with
    the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell
    (because the spellâ€™s magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end.
    Dispel Magic cannot partially dispel spells, so a target under the effects of a
    spell whose magnitude is higher than that of Dispel Magic will not have any
    spells currently affecting it eliminated.</p>
