  description: |-
    <p>For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target’s hit points
    increase by +2. A target cannot have its hit points increased in this way to
    more than twice its original score.  Damage is taken from the ‘magical’ hit
    points first, so when the spell dissipates the inflicted damage taken on the
    magical hit points disappears too</p>
