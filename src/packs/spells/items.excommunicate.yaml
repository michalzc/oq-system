  description: |-
    <p>This spell severs the mystical link an Initiate enjoys with their god,
    causing the target of the spell to immediately and permanently lose all Divine
    Magic from the casterâ€™s religion. The target will never again be able to learn
    or use Divine Magic spells from the religion. However, they will still be able
    to use their Religion skill for purely academic purposes.</p> <p>A Priest of the
    same religion as the target casts the spell in a ceremony that takes one hour to
    cast. The Initiate need not be present.</p>
