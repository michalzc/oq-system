  description: |-
    <p>There is an unlimited number of Form/Set spells in existence, one for every
    substance imaginable, from steel to smoke to water.</p> <p>Each point of
    magnitude allows the caster to shape one ENC of solid substance or one cubic
    metre of an ethereal substance (like darkness). The caster must be familiar with
    the shape they are forming.</p> <p>When the caster has finished the forming
    process, the substance retains its shape. Rigid substances like steel will hold
    the form they had at the end of the spell, while more mutable substances like
    water will immediately lose their shape.</p> <p>This spell can be used to mend
    the damage done to an object. The sorcerer must form the entire object and must
    succeed at an appropriate Craft test.  If successful they will restore the item
    to its original condition.</p> <p>This spell can only be used on inanimate
    substances.</p>
