    will not be able to personally attack or harm the recipient, including through
    ranged attacks (such as a thrown spectral javelin). A spell cast by a spirit at
    the recipient is blocked unless its magnitude exceeds Spirit Block’s
    magnitude.</p> <p>Spirit Block is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and
