    <p>This spell allows the caster to create items which store Divine Magic
    spell(s) that are blessed by a Priest with power from the religion’s deity.</p>
    <p>Only Priests and High Priests can create blessed items.</p> <p>The enchanter
    forgets the spell(s) they blessed the item with.</p> <p>The wielder of the item
    can cast the spell(s) that has blessed the item but doing so discharges the
    item’s power. After discharging it, to recharge the item, it is taken to a
    temple of the religion that created it. This recharge takes as many hours as the
    magnitude of the spell. If the magnitude of the spell is higher than two, the
    consecrating team must have at least one Priest.</p> <p>The wielder must be a
    member of either the religion that created the blessed item or an allied
    religion.</p> <p>Blessed items become protected by the religion’s deity and are
    unbreakable by normal non-magical means.</p>
