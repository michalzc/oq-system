  description: |-
    <p>Eminently useful for finding valuables from afar, this spell has a variation
    for every substance imaginable. Sense (Substance) will cause all sources of the
    substance within range of the spell to glow an appropriate colour, visible only
    to the caster – diamonds will gleam like ice, amber will shine like a camp-fire
    and so on. Each point of this spell’s magnitude allows it to penetrate one metre
    of rock, wood or dirt. If the source is concealed behind such a material, the
    surface nearest the caster will glow for a moment. The spell cannot penetrate
    refined metal, though it can penetrate ore.</p>
