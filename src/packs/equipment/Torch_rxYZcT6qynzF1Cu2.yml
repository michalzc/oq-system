    <p>It will burn for one hour. A torch illuminates within a three metre
    radius.

    If used as a weapon, it is considered a club (wielded with a –20% penalty),

    except that it does not inflict normal damage – instead, it inflicts 1D4
    fire

    damage and a fumble, or critical hit will also extinguish the brand.</p>
