  description: <p>This skill is used when characters trade, barter or otherwise negotiate
    over the sale of goods. In such transactions, a successful opposed test using
    the Trade of the buyer versus the Trade of the seller is needed for the buyer
    to get the best deal.  If the buyer wins, they receive a discount, -10% for success,
    -20% for a critical. If the seller wins, the price that they can sell the item
    for increases by +10% for success and +20% for a critical. If the opponent fumbles
    their roll, double the increase or decrease.</p><p>The Trade skill also enables
    the character to determine the value placed on something by others; by estimating
    its market value. Everyday or obscure objects might give a bonus or penalty to
    the skill test. Success will allow a character to guess the average monetary value
    of the object, usually guessing accurately to within 10% of its actual value.</p>
