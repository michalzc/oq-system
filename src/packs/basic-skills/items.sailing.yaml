  description: <p>This skill covers small water-borne craft propelled manually by
    oars or paddles, commonly known as boats, and larger craft powered by sail or
    rows of oars. Travelling across calm water does not usually require a skill test,
    but adverse conditions such as currents and weather can bestow penalties.</p>
