    \ at no more than walking pace across flat terrain, a Driving skill test will\
    \ never be required. Skill tests are needed when a character wants to do something\
    \ out of the ordinary with a vehicle \u2013 such as to travel across treacherous\
    \ terrain, jump obstacles and so on.</p>"
