  description: "<p>Deception covers the arts of:</p><p><em>Disguise:</em> Used to\
    \ change a character\u2019s appearance and adopt a different outward persona.</p><p><em>Sleight:</em>\
    \ Used to hide or take objects, without drawing undue attention.</p><p><em>Stealth:</em>\
    \ Used whenever a character attempts to evade detection by another character personally.\
    \ Usually, this happens when a character either tries to creep past an enemy,\
    \ hide from one, or performs a combination of both.</p><p>When testing the skill,\
    \ Deception is often opposed by the Perception skill and is modified according\
    \ to the situation. Note that attempts at Fast Talk use the Influence skill rather\
    \ than Deception.</p>"
