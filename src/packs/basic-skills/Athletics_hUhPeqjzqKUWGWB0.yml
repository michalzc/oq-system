    <p>This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to
    adventuring characters, including acrobatics, climbing, jumping and
    swimming.</p><p><em>Acrobatics:</em> This allows a character to perform a
    variety of gymnastics and balancing tasks, such as tumbling, walking a
    tightrope or keeping balance on a narrow or unstable ledge. The character
    can move at half their normal speed across an unstable surface without
    penalty. To move at a normal rate requires an Acrobatics test. A successful
    Acrobatics test will also halve the damage suffered from
    falling.</p><p><em>Brute Force:</em> Brute force is an application of
    Athletics that relies purely on power, with no finesse involved. Brute force
    involves pushing, lifting or dragging.</p><p><em>Climbing:</em> Given enough
    hand and footholds, a character can climb any surface, given enough time,
    without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, a character can
    ascend or descend one-quarter of their Movement per Combat Round (see
    Chapter 5 Combat for details). A character can double the rate of their
    climb or descent by making a Hard Athletics test.</p><p><em>Jumping:</em> In
    general, a successful Athletics test allows a character to jump up to twice
    their height horizontally or up to half their height vertically, if they
    have at least five metres to run first. For standing jumps, half these
    distances. For humans, average height is roughly 1.8m which gives a jumping
    distance of 4m.</p><p>For greater distances, the Referee can apply a -20% or
    even -50% penalty. If the distance involved is absurd, the Referee should
    feel free to say the test is impossible</p><p><em>Swimming:</em> Characters
    usually swim at half their usual movement. Athletics tests are only required
    when conditions are less than ideal â€“ swimming while heavily encumbered or
    in strong currents, for example.</p>
