    <p>Use of this skill will always require a healerâ€™s kit, which includes
    suitable medical equipment, such as bandages and salves, or an appropriate
    improvised alternative. Each use of the Healing skill generally takes a few
    minutes to perform. Both characters must remain stationary and may not use
    combat actions or reactions while this occurs or they will lose the benefits
    of the healing.</p><p>See the following table for the range of Healing
    actions available to the characters using this skill.</p><p>All healing
    actions are stressful, so they always require a skill test to perform
    successfully.</p>
