    <p>If a character is riding a creature with the help of saddle and stirrups,
    at no more than a walking pace across flat terrain, then a Riding test will
    never be required.  Tests are required when a character wants to do
    something out of the ordinary with a mount â€“ such as travel across
    treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, ride bareback and so on.</p>
