  description: >-
    <p>Religion is used to recall knowledge of a religious nature, though the
    character will only be able to remember knowledge pertinent to the specified
    religion.</p><p>Learning Religion (Own) requires a character to be at least
    a lay member of a religion. Normally, a character will only be a member of
    one religion. So, Religion (Other) usually relates to foreign religions and
    is learned through observation or being taught by a member of the religion
    in question.</p><p>The Religion skill is not needed actually to cast Divine
    magic. Still, it is used to advance in status and power within the Religions
    that the character is a member of and to grant access to higher magnitudes
    of Divine magic.</p>
