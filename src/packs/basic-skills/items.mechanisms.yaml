  description: <p>The Mechanisms skill is used for picking a lock or disassembling
    a trap. Usually, this takes at least one minute (12 combat rounds) to perform,
    whereas larger or particularly complex devices will take longer.</p><p>Usually,
    a character will merely make a Mechanisms test to succeed at assembling or disassembling
    a device, with appropriate bonuses or penalties decided upon by the Referee. If
    a device has been designed to resist attempts at disassembly specifically, the
    Mechanisms test becomes opposed by the Mechanisms skill of the character who created
    it.</p>
