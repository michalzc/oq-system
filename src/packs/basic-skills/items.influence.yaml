  description: "<p>This skill is the art of verbally persuading another character\
    \ to do what you want.</p><p>Influence skill tests are usually opposed by either\
    \ Persistence (as a measure of sheer bloody-minded will power) or Influence (where\
    \ the character argues back). They are further modified by how much a character\
    \ is trying to change an opponent\u2019s mind. Influence skill tests are often\
    \ modified by how well the player roleplays the exchange (see \u201CWhen the Referee\
    \ should apply difficulty modifiers\u201D above).</p><p>Influence can be used\
    \ in one of three ways.</p><ul><li><p><em>Fast Talk</em>. The character tries\
    \ to quickly confuse either an individual or small group with a clear leader,\
    \ into doing what they want.</p></li><li><p><em>Oratory</em>. The character puts\
    \ forward a series of arguments to sway a large crowd of people.</p></li><li><p><em>Intimidation</em>.\
    \ The character tries to use the threat of violence against an opponent or group\
    \ of opponent.</p></li></ul>"
