    <p>This skill covers the successful casting of Sorcery spells which the
    caster knows, and also the ability to manipulate the effects, range and
    duration of those spells. This skill also allows the use of magic items with
    stored spells (commonly called Matrices) and scrolls with Sorcery spells
    written on them. It can also be used to represent the characterâ€™s knowledge
    of Sorcery and its works. See the Sorcery Chapter for details.</p>
