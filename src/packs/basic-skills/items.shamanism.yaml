    <p>This skill provides several spiritual abilities. These abilities,
    although magical in origin, are always on or, in the case of Disassociate
    from Body, can be instantly called on. No magic point spend is needed.</p>
    <p><i>Disassociate from Body.</i> The Shaman can put their body into a deep
    sleep, while their spirit travels the Spirit World. A slender silver cord
    connects the two. If the physical body suffers death, their spirit becomes
    trapped in the Spirit World. While in the Spirit World, if the Shaman
    reaches 1 or 0 magic points, their Spirit returns to their body immediately.
    In this ‘dissociated’ form, the Shaman can engage in Spirit Combat with an
    attack equal to their Shamanism score.  During their time in the Spirit
    World, the Shaman has no physical body, therefore is considered STR, CON,
    DEX and SIZless. They cannot use any skills that are based upon those
    Characteristics or require a physical presence. The only way that a
    dissociated shaman can interact with the physical world is through casting
    spells or spiritually attacking. While disassociated, the Shaman is
    invisible to the physical world.</p> <p><i>See into the Spirit World.</i>
    The Shaman can always see what is happening in the Spirit World and
    therefore detect spirits that are invisible to non-Shamans.</p> <p><i>Assess
    the Harmony of the Spirit World.</i> This ability allows the Shaman to sense
    if something is wrong with the immediate Spirit World to a range of POW in
    kilometers.</p> <p><i>Spirit World Knowledge.</i> The Shaman learns about
    the geography of the Spirit World and the cultures of its inhabitants.</p>
    <p><i>Able to Initiate Spirit Combat.</i> Unlike untrained characters,
    Shamans can engage spirits in Spirit Combat, without having to cast any
    extra magic spells. See the Spirit Combat section, under Magical Combat, in
    the Combat chapter for more details.</p>
