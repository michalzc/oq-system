  description: "<p>The Lore skill is an umbrella term for several different skills,\
    \ each of which must be improved separately.</p><p>Each Lore skill defines an\
    \ area of knowledge for the character, and whenever a player wants to see if their\
    \ character knows something about the subject at hand they use that specific Lore\
    \ skill.</p><p>A player\u2019s imagination is the only limit to the range of possible\
    \ Lores. Example Lores include:  alchemy, art, astronomy, gambling, geography,\
    \ heraldry, law, logistics, military tactics, philosophy, poisons.</p>"
